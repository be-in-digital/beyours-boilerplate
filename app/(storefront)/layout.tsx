 * Site-wide metadata for the storefront.
 *
 * `metadataBase` is the piece every page depends on and none of them could set
 * for themselves: without it Next.js leaves a relative Open Graph image
 * relative, and a relative `og:image` is simply not fetched by the crawlers
 * that matter. Pages that build their own metadata set it too; this covers the
 * ones that do not.
 *
 * No title template. The establishment's name is already in `og:site_name` and
 * in the structured data, and appending it to a meta title the owner wrote
 * themselves is how a page ends up titled "Menu — Chez Luigi — Chez Luigi".

  // Its branding rides along: `resolveStorefrontStore` is memoised per render
  // and `getRestaurantJsonLd` has already called it, so the palette costs this
  // layout nothing and spares a returning visitor the flash of engine orange
  // before the client query lands.
  //
  // NEITHER MAY THROW. `getStorefrontSeoContext` states the invariant this
  // layout has to keep — "a storefront whose backend is briefly unreachable
  // drops its structured data, it does not fail to render" — and it holds only
  // for the call that swallows. Adding a bare `resolveStorefrontStore()` beside
  // it broke it: a layout that throws bubbles past `(storefront)/error.tsx` to
  // `app/error.tsx`, which renders outside every group layout, so a transient
  // Convex hiccup replaced every storefront page with a bare error screen
  // instead of costing it one `<style>` element. Losing the server's palette
  // costs a returning visitor one repaint after hydration; losing the page
  // costs them the page.
