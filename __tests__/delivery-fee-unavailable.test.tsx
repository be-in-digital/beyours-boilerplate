/**
 * An address we cannot price says so, instead of promising a price later.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN. `deliveryFee: null` carried two meanings — "the quote has
 * not come back yet" and "there is no way to work this out" — and the summary
 * printed the optimistic one for both: « Calculée à la validation ». The
 * second case is an address with no coordinates (saved before quoting existed,
 * or typed over the autocomplete instead of chosen from it), and at validation
 * the order is refused with « merci de resaisir votre adresse ». So the
 * customer was told to carry on, filled in the rest of the form, and was
 * stopped at the last click by a problem the page had already detected.
 *
 * The checkout page now sets `quoteError` the moment it finds an address it
 * cannot price, and passes `deliveryFeeUnavailable` here so this line stops
 * contradicting the error printed underneath it.
