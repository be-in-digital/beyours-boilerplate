/**
 * A template carries its layout, not only its palette (#507).
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. `demos/assets/themes.js` has assigned all seven families —
 * nav, hero, menu, btn, tex, foot, up — to each of the fifty demo identities
 * since the demos were written, and `scripts/gen-templates.mjs` generates the
 * installed catalogue from exactly that file. It read two of them, `hero` and
 * `menu`, to compose an English sentence for `template.json`'s `description`,
 * and threw the machine-readable value away. The other five it never read.
 *
 * So a design sold "by restaurant type" reached a client as a palette, a radius
 * and a font pair, and the layout half of its identity stayed in the sales
 * demo — which is the gap #41 named and #507 scoped.
 *
 * The four rules below are the ones a reader cannot check by looking: that the
 * two copies of a template's layout agree, that the five hand-kept base
 * directories still match the demo identity they are sold as, that a family
 * claimed as honoured really paints something, and — the one that would cost
 * the most — that no rule reading these attributes can reach the dashboard.

 * How much of the catalogue names a layout the shop does not paint (#529).

 * 31 name a hero outside `HONOURED`, 26 a menu, and 51 a button style — the
 * whole family, since `HONOURED.btn` is empty. Nothing failed on any of it:
 * `layout-families.test.ts` pinned only the out-of-FAMILY fallback, so a value
 * its family admits and no rule paints went straight through.
 *
 * WHY A LEDGER RATHER THAN A CLEAN SWEEP, and this is the "say which" the issue
 * asks for. Neither of the two offered actions is available as written:
 *
 *   - PAINT THEM. Each unpainted value already carries a measured reason it is
 *     not built, written where the rule would go. `btn` is blocked on `--radius`
 *     reaching the shop at all — 405 hard-coded `rounded-*` literals across 44
 *     storefront files and no `--radius-*` token in `@theme inline` (#512). The
 *     five menus want a restructured card body, a 72px thumbnail the 4:3 photo
 *     block cannot become, or a category bar that lives in another component.
 *     The seven heroes want a photograph the hero does not carry, a second
 *     image, a locations board, or — `editorial` — a rating stamp this product
 *     refuses to invent at all.
 *   - REGENERATE THE 51 `layout.ts` WITH ONLY HONOURED VALUES. That erases the
 *     design intent the catalogue is sold on. `pizzeria-trattoria` names
 *     `hero: "poster"` because that is the design; flattening it to `"split"`
 *     would make the file agree with the stylesheet by deleting the thing the
 *     stylesheet is meant to catch up with.
 *
 * So the DOM was made honest instead — `layoutAttributes` now emits the engine's
 * value and records the ask in `data-<family>-requested` — and the gap is a
 * ledger with its numbers pinned. A new unpainted value fails. Painting one
 * fails too, until its count comes down, which is the direction that matters.
