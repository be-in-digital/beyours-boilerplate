/**
 * The public blog must read the database, and its links must go somewhere.
 *
 * Six articles were hard-coded across three storefront files — Unsplash
 * photography, dates in the future — and every card linked to `/blog/${slug}`
 * on a route that did not exist. Twelve dead links on every client site, and
 * `listPublishedArticles` sitting there with no callers.
 *
 * This is a source-level check because that is the shape of the defect: the
 * queries worked, the components did not call them. A behavioural test of a
 * component that renders a constant passes just as happily as one that renders
 * the truth.
