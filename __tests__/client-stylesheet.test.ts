/**
 * `app/globals.css` must be readable from the client repository, not just from
 * here.
 *
 * This app is published verbatim to `beyours-boilerplate`, the repository a
 * client site is cloned from, where it is the REPOSITORY ROOT rather than
 * `apps/themes` inside a monorepo. Every relative path in a shipped file
 * therefore has to resolve without leaving this directory. Two `@source` globs
 * did not:
 *
 *     @source "../../../packages/ui/src/**\/*.{ts,tsx}"
 *     @source "../../../packages/admin/src/**\/*.{ts,tsx}"
 *
 * Here they reach `packages/`. On a client site they resolve above the
 * repository root and match nothing, and Tailwind does not complain about a
 * source glob that finds no files — so the monorepo built 3102 rules and every
 * client built 2526. The 576 missing rules were every class used only inside
 * `packages/ui` or `packages/admin`: the viewport-height cap on the promotion
 * form's scrolling body, the minimum height that centres the store guard. The
 * dialog that had already been fixed once for rendering 1549px tall with its
 * submit button off screen was doing it again, on every site we had sold, while
 * CI here was green.
 *
 * Those class names are described rather than spelled on purpose. Tailwind's
 * automatic detection scans this directory too, so writing one here would emit
 * its rule from THIS FILE — and the canary would keep singing in a client build
 * that had lost every other rule the engine contributes.
 *
 * `scripts/check-mirror-css.mjs` is the proof: it materialises the published
 * tree and compiles it. This file is the fast half of the same guarantee — it
 * runs in the Test job in milliseconds and states the rule that makes the
 * compile come out right, so a bad path is caught where it is written rather
 * than at the far end of a build.
