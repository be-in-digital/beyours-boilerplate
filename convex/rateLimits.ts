/**
 * The rate limiter, reachable from an ACTION.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (#430.5). `consumeRateLimit` reads and writes the
 * `rateLimits` table, and it does so deliberately inside the same transaction
 * as the write it protects — a limiter that commits separately from the thing
 * it limits is a limiter with a gap in it. That works for a mutation and is
 * impossible for an action, which has no `ctx.db` at all.
 *
 * So every public-by-design mutation in this deployment was bounded and every
 * public-by-design ACTION was not — and the actions are the expensive half.
 * `stripe.createCheckoutSession`, `sumup.createCheckout`,
 * `paypal.createPayPalOrder` and `uberDirect.getDeliveryQuote` are reachable
 * with no session at all, and each one calls a third party the restaurant pays
 * for or is quota'd by. A script could burn an establishment's Uber Direct
 * quota until real deliveries stopped being quotable, at no cost to itself.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT, AND STATED RATHER THAN GLOSSED. An action consuming
 * through this mutation gets a limiter that commits BEFORE the work it bounds,
 * not with it. That is strictly weaker than the mutation case: a caller whose
 * request dies between the two has spent a unit for nothing. It is also the
 * right way round for this use — the unit is spent before the third party is
 * called, so a flood is refused rather than merely counted afterwards — and
 * over-counting a dropped request costs a diner one of ten retries, where the
 * other order would leave the quota-burning call unmetered.
