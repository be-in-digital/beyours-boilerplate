/**
 * Import rows into a table — clears existing data, then inserts.
 *
 * Convex will not let an insert choose its `_id`, so every restored row comes
 * back under a new one. That used to end the story: `stores` came back with new
 * ids while the products, menus, CMS pages and promotions restored after them
 * came back carrying the **old** `storeId`, and `v.id("stores")` waved it
 * through because it validates an id's encoding, not that it resolves. The
 * deployment came up with every catalogue detached from its establishment, and
 * `userProfiles.storeIds` naming stores that no longer existed — so the owner
 * was locked out of everything. Silently, and irreversibly.
 *
 * `idMap` carries `old id → new id` from the tables already imported, and every
 * id inside a row is rewritten through it before the insert. The caller passes
 * back what this returns, which is why `system.importBackup` walks the tables in
 * dependency order: a reference can only be rewritten once its target has been
 * inserted.
 *
 * References the map cannot resolve — a table never exported, or a row deleted
 * before the backup was taken — are left as they are. `backupRemap` explains
 * why they are not counted: there is no portable way to tell a reference from
 * an ordinary string, and the restore says plainly what a backup does not carry
 * instead of reporting a number that would be zero in exactly the case it
 * exists to catch.

 * been invoiced — and the half that exists for an order invoiced before
 * `orders.invoiceId` was populated. After a restore it found nothing, so such
 * an order could be deleted with its invoice standing. `by_storeId_issuedAt` is
 * how an establishment's invoices are listed, and that list came back empty.
 *
 * This is not editing the document. Art. 242 nonies A fixes the number, the
 * dates, the parties, the lines and the figures; `orderId` and `storeId` are
 * this deployment's pointers at the sale and the establishment, and re-pointing

 * rewrites a string only when the map has an entry for it, and the map only
 * ever holds ids of rows `importTable` inserted, so no invoice id is ever in
 * it. On the deployment the backup came from that is harmless: the invoices are

 *
 * so the sale could never be invoiced again — not by `orders`' automatic path,

 *    SECOND invoice be issued for a sale that already has one;
 *  - it does not and none stands — the field is cleared, and the order is
 *    invoiceable again from this deployment's own series.
 *
 * Clearing deletes nothing fiscal. The invoices are in the backup file, and on
 * a rebuilt deployment that file is the only copy of the old series and must be
 * kept as such (art. L102 B LPF, six years). `numberSequences` is export-only
 * too, so the rebuilt deployment starts a fresh series rather than reissuing
 * numbers that have already been handed out. The count comes back to
