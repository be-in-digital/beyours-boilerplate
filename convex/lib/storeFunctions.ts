/**
 * App-local instantiation of the engine's authorisation seam.
 *
 * The policy itself lives in `@be-in-digital/convex-functions/storeFunctions`
 * so that every app — including `apps/themes`, the template cloned for each
 * client — applies the same rules. All this file does is bind it to this app's
 * generated `query` / `mutation` builders and re-export the result, so existing
 * imports of `./lib/storeFunctions` keep working unchanged.
