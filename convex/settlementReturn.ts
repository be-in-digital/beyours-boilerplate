/**
 * Settling a charge on a RETURN PAGE, and saying so when we refuse one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Six code paths in this deployment settle a provider payment.
 * `stripeWebhook.ts` and `payments.settleFromChargeEvent` are driven by the
 * provider and record a refusal where an operator reads it; the reconciliation
 * sweep does the same since #438. The other three — the pages a diner is sent
 * back to after paying, one per provider — did not.
 *
 * They are the paths that fire FIRST. A diner completes a Stripe checkout and
 * their browser hits `verifyCheckoutSession` seconds later, well before the
 * webhook lands. If the settlement is refused there — the amount no longer
 * binds, the order was already collected by another charge (#378, #411) — the
 * refusal was thrown out of the action, the page showed an error, and nothing
 * anywhere recorded that a charge had been taken and not banked. Measured on
 * the bench: 2 400 c taken, 1 200 c on the ledger, `FA-2026-000001` minted
 * against it, and zero `payment_collection_refused` rows.
 *
 * A refusal is not a failure. The provider does not report a charge it did not
 * take, so by the time we refuse, the diner's account is already debited.
 * Refusing the row keeps the LEDGER honest; this is the half that makes
 * somebody give the money back.
 *
 * The recording never replaces the refusal: the error is rethrown, so the
 * caller's own error path — the one that tells the diner something went wrong —
 * behaves exactly as it did. And a failure to write the audit row must not
 * swallow the refusal it was describing, which is why the write is `.catch`ed.
 * Same rule `recordRefusedCollection` follows in the engine, for the same
 * reason.
