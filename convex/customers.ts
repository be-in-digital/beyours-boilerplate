/**
 * Build the customer book from the orders already there.
 *
 * WHY A MIGRATION AND NOT A READ (#364). `customers` is an aggregate maintained
 * incrementally, on the same transitions as `emailSubscribers.metadata` — so it
 * only holds people who have ordered SINCE it existed. An establishment trading
 * for two years would open a Clients screen showing whoever ordered that
 * afternoon, which is worse than an empty one: an empty screen is obviously
 * empty and a short one looks complete.
 *
 * ONE PAGE PER CALL, and the caller loops. Convex refuses a transaction that
 * reads more than 16,384 documents, which is the ceiling #432.4 was about — and
 * orders is the largest table a restaurant has, so a backfill written as one
 * pass would be a backfill that cannot run on exactly the deployments that need
 * it most.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT ONLY FROM THE START. The accumulation is incremental — it adds
 * each order to whatever the book already holds — so running a PAGE twice
 * counts those orders twice. That matters because a paged migration is a
 * migration that can be interrupted, and the honest way to recover from one is
 * to run it again from the beginning.
 *
 * So `resetCustomerBook` below empties the book first, and the migration runs
 * it to completion before the first page. Re-running the whole migration
 * rebuilds from the orders and lands on the same numbers; resuming from a
 * saved cursor does not, and is not offered.
 *
 * WHAT IT COUNTS: orders that reached `confirmed` and were not cancelled, which
 * is the same rule the incremental writer applies. `status` is what it has to
 * go on — an order's history is not stored — so an order confirmed and then
 * cancelled counts as neither, where the incremental path would have counted it
 * and given it back. The two agree on the end state, which is what the screen
 * shows.
