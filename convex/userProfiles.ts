// role, permissions and store list by guessing a user id. Its only caller —
// `AdminAuthSync` — was reading the *current* user's own profile, which is what
// `getMyProfile` below does safely.

 * Get the authenticated user's own profile.

/**
 * Create or update another user's profile.
 *
 * INTERNAL, and that is the point. The previous guard only rejected the literal
 * strings "super_admin" and "client_admin", so `manager` — which carries
 * products, orders and customers write access — passed straight through, on any
 * store id the caller chose. The whole policy now lives in
 * `assertCanAssignProfile`, and it held: an adversarial pass over seven
 * starting roles, three target roles and both self and other could not get an
 * administrative profile out of it.
 *
 * It was still a PUBLIC mutation whose validator accepts `super_admin`, with no
 * caller in either app's interface — the entire product reaches profiles
 * through `teamMembers.*` instead. A publicly reachable escalation surface that
 * nothing uses is a surface kept alive by its guard alone, and this repository
 * has already shipped one regression (#129) through an `any`-typed API injector
 * that hid a call the compiler could not see. Internal removes the surface
 * rather than defending it.
 *
 * The policy still runs, and is still tested — the tests reach it through
 * `internal.` now, and one of them asserts it is no longer publicly callable.
 * A super admin who genuinely has to rewrite a profile by hand still can,
 * through `internalUpsert` and a deploy key, which is how `seed-users.mts`
 * already provisions every seeded account.
