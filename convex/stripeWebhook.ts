/**
 * Stripe webhook handler (Convex HTTP action).
 * Delegates Stripe SDK signature verification to a Node.js internalAction
 * because httpAction cannot use "use node".
 *
 * WHY IT HANDLES FIVE EVENT TYPES: it handled one,
 * `checkout.session.completed`, and answered 200 to the rest. A customer who
 * paid and closed the tab before the confirmation page left a paid Stripe
 * charge and an order stuck at `paymentStatus: "pending"` — the kitchen never
 * saw it. A refund issued from the Stripe dashboard moved real money and left
 * the admin still offering the whole amount as refundable.
 *
 * Only the checkout session carries our `metadata.orderId`. The other four
 * resolve through `payments.externalId`, the payment intent stored when the
 * charge was first settled.
 *
 * It is one function rather than a router plus handlers because the settlement
 * guard has to be visibly inside the route that settles: `settlement-binding`
 * asserts it against this export by name.
