 * The one place a Convex action reaches an email provider.
 *
 * Four actions used to construct their own `SESv2Client` from `process.env`,
 * each repeating the region default, the credential reads and the same
 * `noreply@beindigital.fr` fallback — an address that belongs to the agency and
 * to no client, so a deployment that had not set `AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL` sent from
 * a domain its own SES account cannot sign for, and the send was refused.
 *
 * Worse, none of it could be pointed anywhere else. Every client owns its AWS
 * account and files its own SES production-access request; approval is not
 * guaranteed and one has already been refused. `apps/site` had the escape hatch
 * — `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` — and the engine did not, so a refused client had
 * no path to sending email at all. See #212.
 *
 * `"use node"` because the SES operations pull in the AWS SDK. The decision
 * itself lives in `@be-in-digital/core/email/providers`, which imports no SDK,
 * so the choice is testable without one.
