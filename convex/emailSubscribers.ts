 * only an app has. The shared handler mints the token and stores it; getting it
 * to the person is the app's half, and it was the half that did not exist.
 *
 * Scheduled rather than awaited, and deliberately not guarded by a try/catch:
 * a signup must not fail in front of a visitor because SES is slow, and a send
 * that throws should surface in the Convex logs rather than be swallowed.
 *
 * Re-reads the row instead of taking the token as an argument — a token in a
 * scheduler argument is a credential written to a second place, and the action
 * has to re-read the subscriber anyway to know they are still `pending`.
