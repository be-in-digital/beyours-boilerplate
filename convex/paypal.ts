/**
 * The orders whose PayPal approval never came back.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN (#431.2). PayPal had no webhook and no reconciliation of any
 * kind — `crons.ts` reconciled Stripe alone. A diner who approved a payment and
 * closed the tab before the redirect completed left the authorisation at PayPal,
 * our order at `pending`, and the kitchen blind. Permanently: no path in the
 * product ever asked again.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT FROM SumUp's. A PayPal order is approved and then
 * CAPTURED, and the capture is what takes the money. So there are two states
 * worth recovering and they are not the same:
 *
 *   - `COMPLETED` — already captured. The redirect died after the capture, so
 *     the money has moved and only our record is missing. Settle it.
 *   - `APPROVED` — approved and never captured. The money has NOT moved. This
 *     sweep captures it, which is the same call `capturePayPalOrder` makes from
 *     the return page and the only thing that turns an approval into a payment.
 *     An authorisation left uncaptured expires, and the restaurant is paid
 *     nothing for a meal it has cooked.
 *
 * Anything else — `CREATED`, `VOIDED`, `PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED` — is left alone.
 * An abandoned approval is not a failed payment, and marking it as one hides a
 * customer who is about to come back.
 *
 * The binding is the same as the return page's: `reference_id` must be this
 * order and the captured amount must equal its total, to the cent, or nothing
 * is marked paid. A sweep acts on a provider's word with no diner in front of
 * it, so it is the last place to relax that.
