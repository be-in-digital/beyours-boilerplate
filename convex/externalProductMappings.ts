//  - the store-scoped ones below, for the admin;
//  - the internal ones, for the webhook and import paths. Those run as
//    `internalAction`s with no user identity, so a store-scoped guard there
//    would reject Uber Eats and Deliveroo themselves.

// one — not as a permission guard, since it runs from an `internalAction` with
// no identity, but because a PLU is only unique inside one establishment and
// resolving it across the deployment matched another restaurant's dish. All
// three have no UI caller — internal is the whole surface they need.
