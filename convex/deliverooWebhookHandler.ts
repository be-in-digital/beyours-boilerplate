/**
 * Verify Deliveroo's HMAC-SHA256 over the raw bytes.
 *
 * THIS DELEGATES NOW, AND THAT IS THE FIX (#433.2). There were two verifiers.
 * `packages/integrations/src/deliveroo/security.ts` is the hardened one — and
 * it was dead code:
 *
 *     $ grep -rn "verifyWebhookSignature" packages apps --include='*.ts' \
 *         | grep -v __tests__ | grep -v /dist/
 *     packages/integrations/src/deliveroo/security.ts:44:export async function …
 *     apps/themes/e2e/deliveroo/webhook-signing.test.ts:59
 *     apps/reference/e2e/deliveroo/webhook-signing.test.ts:59
 *
 * Only the two test files imported it. The delivered route had its own copy,
 * which DROPPED the package's hex-format check and its 64-character length
 * check, and stripped a `sha256=` prefix the package deliberately refuses.
 *
 * So `webhook-signing.test.ts`'s own docblock — *"The real verifier and the
 * real route. `verifyWebhookSignature` … is put in front of the code that will
 * judge it in production"* — was false of the tree it ran on. The suite proved
 * a function no client executed, over a route it never touched.
 *
 * The barrel is safe to import here: nothing under `packages/integrations/src`
 * touches a Node built-in, so the V8 runtime this `httpAction` runs in can
 * bundle it. Checked rather than assumed —
 * `grep -rn 'from "node:' packages/integrations/src` is empty.
