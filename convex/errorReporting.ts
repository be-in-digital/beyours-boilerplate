/**
 * Where a backend error goes.
 *
 * Before this file the answer was `console.error`, 112 times in this directory
 * alone, and a `console.error` in a Convex function lands in the dashboard of
 * ONE client's deployment. Every Stripe, Deliveroo, Uber Eats and SES webhook
 * runs here; so does every order mutation and the whole kitchen path. With one
 * deployment per client, a Saturday-night order that fails inside Convex was
 * visible to nobody, and finding it meant logging into each client's console
 * one at a time — while the maintenance contract sells support.
 *
 * The Next.js half has reported to Sentry for a while (`sentry.server.config.ts`,
 * `instrumentation.ts`, `app/global-error.tsx`). `apps/docs/deployment/sentry.md`
 * said the rest out loud: *"Convex. Backend functions run outside Next and
 * report nothing here."* This is that sentence being retired. Same DSN, same
 * per-client project, same scrubbing — so a failed checkout raises one issue
 * whether it broke in the browser, in the route handler or in the mutation.
 *
 * NO `"use node"`, deliberately. A `"use node"` module may only export actions,
 * and nothing outside one can import from it — which would exclude every
 * `httpAction` (they cannot be `"use node"` at all) and therefore every webhook,
 * i.e. exactly the surface this exists for. The default Convex runtime has
 * `fetch`, and `@be-in-digital/core/sentry` builds the envelope with no SDK.
 *
 * ## How to use it
 *
 * From an action or an `httpAction`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * } catch (error) {
 *   console.error("[Stripe Webhook] …", error);
 *   await captureBackendError(ctx, { error, source: "stripeWebhook", tags: { … } });
 *   return new Response("Processing error", { status: 500 });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `console.error` STAYS. The Convex dashboard is still the fastest place to
 * read a log while a deploy is in front of you; this adds a second destination,
 * it does not replace the first.
 *
 * ## The one trap
 *
 * From a **mutation**, the report is scheduled inside the mutation's
 * transaction — so it survives only if the mutation goes on to COMMIT. That is
 * the right behaviour for the `console.error`-and-continue pattern this
 * codebase uses everywhere, and the wrong one for a mutation that rethrows: the
 * throw rolls the transaction back and takes the scheduled report with it.
 * Report a rethrowing mutation from the action or `httpAction` above it, which
 * is not a transaction and cannot be rolled back.
 *
 * See `apps/docs/deployment/sentry.md`.
