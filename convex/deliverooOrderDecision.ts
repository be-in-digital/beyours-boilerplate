/**
 * Accepting or refusing a Deliveroo order by hand (#103, #104).
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. `storeIntegrations.orderMode` offers three settings —
 * `auto_accept`, `auto_reject` and `manual` — and the webhook honours the first
 * two. Under `manual` it logged the mode and did nothing else, so the order sat
 * in the product with no control anywhere that could accept or refuse it: the
 * audit's "trapped failed deliveries" and "missing manual Deliveroo controls".
 * A restaurant that chose manual had no way to run a service.
 *
 * The API calls existed — `deliveroo.acceptOrder` and `deliveroo.rejectOrder` in
 * `@be-in-digital/integrations` — and only the webhook's automatic paths called
 * them.
 *
 * BOTH SIDES MOVE, AND THE PLATFORM MOVES FIRST. Deliveroo is the party that owes
 * the diner an answer, so the call goes out before the internal status changes: if
 * the platform refuses the decision, nothing here claims it happened. The reverse
 * order would leave a restaurant reading « confirmée » on an order Deliveroo still
 * considers pending.
