 * metadata for the admin UI" — and neither was ever exposed. So an owner could
 * complete the OAuth consent and have no way to tell whether it had taken, and
 * no way to end it: the only evidence a connection existed at all was a menu
 * sync succeeding or failing.
 *
 * `settings:read` / `settings:write`, matching `storeIntegrations`: this is one
 * connection for the whole deployment, with no store to scope against, so the
 * guard is a role check rather than the store-scoped seam.
 *
 * The handler returns metadata only — never the encrypted tokens.
