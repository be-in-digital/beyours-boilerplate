// that already proved the provider signed the body, and the sweep runs on the
// scheduler with no identity at all. Nothing outside this backend has any
// business claiming or retiring a provider delivery.

 * Claim a provider delivery before handling it.
 *
 * Returns "fresh" (record written, go ahead), "in_flight" (a previous attempt
 * died before finishing — let the retry through) or "already_processed".
