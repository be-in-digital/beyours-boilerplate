/**
 * `GET $CONVEX_SITE_URL/health` — one URL an uptime monitor can watch.
 *
 * There was no health route anywhere, in any app. With one Convex deployment
 * per client, "is that restaurant's backend up?" had no answer short of opening
 * its dashboard, and nothing external could ask the question on a schedule. The
 * error reporting in `errorReporting.ts` covers the case where a function runs
 * and fails; this covers the case where nothing runs at all, which is the one
 * that produces no error to report.
 *
 * It lives on the Convex HTTP router rather than in Next.js on purpose. A Next
 * route answering `200` proves Vercel is serving — it proves nothing about the
 * deployment that holds the orders, and those are separate systems that fail
 * separately. `app/api/health/route.ts` calls THIS and reports both.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * No authentication: a monitor cannot hold a credential, and the response is
 * built to be safe unauthenticated. It reports *whether* things are configured,
 * never what they are configured to — no DSN, no URL, no key, no count of
 * anything a competitor could read as trade.
 *
 * No write. A health check that writes is a health check that fills a table.
