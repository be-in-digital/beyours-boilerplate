/**
 * Verify the RSA signature Amazon SNS puts on every message.
 *
 * `/webhooks/ses` used to authenticate nothing: it checked that the body's own
 * `SigningCertURL` field looked like an Amazon host and treated that as proof.
 * An unauthenticated POST could therefore forge a bounce or a complaint for any
 * address — the handler reads the subscriber, store and campaign ids straight
 * out of the same unsigned body — suppressing mail to a real customer and
 * moving the campaign counters with it.
 *
 * Node, not the V8 runtime, for the same reason as `stripeWebhookVerify.ts`:
 * `crypto.createVerify` takes a PEM certificate directly, where Web Crypto
 * would need the SubjectPublicKeyInfo picked out of the X.509 DER by hand.
