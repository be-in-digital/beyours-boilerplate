 * `create` does it. `requireStaff` rather than `stores:read`: the kitchen and
 * delivery roles do not hold that permission and still render behind
 * `StoreGuard`, which is built from this list.
 *
 * Staff-only was ALL it checked (#94). Membership was never applied, so a
 * kitchen account attached to one restaurant received the name, address,
 * phone, email, opening hours and delivery radius of every other restaurant
 * its owner runs. The scope now comes from the same `storeIds` every other
 * guard reads; only a super admin, whose remit is the chain, still sees all of
 * them.
 *
 * `printConfig.apiKey` is stripped here as it is on the public queries. The one
 * read that returns it is `getAdminById`, behind `stores:read`.
