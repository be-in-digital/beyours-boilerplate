/**
 * Answering a diner's RGPD request, and enforcing the retention window.
 *
 * The policy is in `@be-in-digital/convex-functions/privacy` so that both this
 * bench and `apps/themes` — the template cloned for every client — apply the
 * same rules. What lives here is what cannot: the `internal` references the
 * scheduler needs, which the package has none of. Same split as
 * `stores.remove` and its cascade.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE `query`/`mutation` RATHER THAN `storeQuery`/`storeMutation`:
 * a data-subject request spans every establishment the caller administers, and
 * three of the tables it has to reach — `customerAddresses`, `rateLimits`,
 * `userProfiles` — have no `storeId` at all. There is no single store to scope
 * to. `requirePrivacyScope` is the guard instead: it throws unless the caller
 * holds `customers:manage`, and returns the establishments they may act on,
 * which the report then names.
 *
 * WHY THE GUARD IS CALLED HERE rather than left inside the shared handler: an
 * exposed function should say how it is authorised at the point it is exposed.
 * The policy still lives in one place — this is a call to it, not a second
 * copy — and the scope it returns is passed on, so nothing is resolved twice.
