/**
 * No shipped test may read a path above the application root unguarded.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/lib/mirror-tree.mjs` copies every git-tracked file
 * under `apps/themes` onto `be-in-digital/beyours-boilerplate`, `tests/`
 * included, and `check:mirror-build` runs that delivered tree's own suite
 * before a sync is allowed. A test that reaches for `packages/` or for the
 * sibling app is reaching for something only this monorepo has: in the
 * delivered tree the same expression resolves to the directory ABOVE the
 * repository, and the two ways it then fails are not equally visible.
 *
 *   LOUD  — a `readFileSync` or `readdirSync` on a path that is not there.
 *           ENOENT, the suite dies, the sync is refused, and no client site
 *           receives anything until somebody reads the run.
 *
 *   QUIET — a scan root guarded by `existsSync` that returns an empty list.
 *           No error: a number, and the wrong one. `public-surface.test.ts`
 *           once reported the 79 public functions whose callers live in the
 *           engine as having no caller at all.
 *
 * `tests/lib/repo-layout.ts` was written for exactly this and says so at
 * length. What was missing was anything that MADE a new file use it.
 *
 * WHAT IT COST, measured. The class has now fired twice. `a7862e90` was the
 * first: three files, and the boilerplate's CI red since 7 September. The
 * second ran from 15 September 12:48 to the commit that adds this file — the
 * mirror refused every sync for the whole of that window, so seven merged
 * commits reached no client at all, and the run says `Test Files 4 failed |
 * 173 passed` on four separate causes that arrived in three different pull
 * requests (#540, #549, #555). None of them was a wrong path anybody could see
 * in review: `join(process.cwd(), "../../packages/…")` is what the file next
 * to it already did.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE HAS NO TWIN IN `apps/reference`, alone among its neighbours.
 * The rule is about the tree that SHIPS, and only `apps/themes` does. The bench
 * is the agency's: fifteen of its suites read the root `scripts/` and
 * `.github/workflows/` on purpose — `mirror-publisher`, `publish-plan`,
 * `commit-attribution` — and there is no client for whom those paths are
 * missing. Copying this guard there would have accused all fifteen of a defect
 * they do not have. `check-app-divergence.mjs` permits the asymmetry: parity is
 * enforced over `e2e/` and `convex/` only, and a file one app lacks is skipped
 * rather than failed.
 *
 * WHY A RESOLVER AND NOT A PATTERN. The literal `"../.."` is the wrong thing
 * to match on — 110 of these 156 files contain one, almost all of them
 * ordinary imports that stay inside the app (`"../../convex/schema"` from
 * `tests/convex/` IS the app root). What matters is where the path LANDS, so
 * each expression is resolved against its real base and compared to the app
 * root. Measured against the CI run above, this scan names the four failing
 * files and nothing else — a pattern match on the literal would have cried
 * wolf 106 times, and a guard that does that is switched off within a week.
