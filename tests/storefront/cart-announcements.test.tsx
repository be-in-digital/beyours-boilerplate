/**
 * A cart a blind diner can follow.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, at `b9e20ea`. Adding a dish announced itself, because
 * `sonner` renders its toasts into a live region and the product card raises
 * one. Nothing else did. Quantity plus and minus, removing a line, emptying
 * the Box, the header badge, the subtotal and the total were bare `<span>`s,
 * and a `<span>` whose text changes is announced by nothing. Four
 * `aria-live`/`role="status"` attributes existed across the 36 files on the
 * buying path and none of them was in a cart — so a diner could press
 * « Augmenter la quantité » four times, be told nothing four times, and reach
 * the checkout without ever having heard what they were about to pay.
 *
 * The two halves this pins:
 *
 *   the CONTROL's name — the cart button carries the count, so reaching it
 *   says how many dishes are in the Box rather than "Ouvrir la Box";
 *   the CHANGE — one polite region in the shell, announcing the new state
 *   after every mutation, wherever it was made from.
 *
 * The region is deliberately outside the cart sheet. A live region must exist
 * before its contents change, and the sheet is a dialog that unmounts when
 * closed, so a region inside it would miss every mutation made from a product
 * card. That is asserted below by mutating with the sheet never opened at all.
