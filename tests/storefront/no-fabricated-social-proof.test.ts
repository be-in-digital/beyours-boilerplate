/**
 * A delivered client site may not invent its own social proof.
 *
 * Until this suite existed, every storefront shipped from this template
 * published, on its own homepage and with no way for the owner to remove any
 * of it:
 *
 *   - three five-star customer testimonials signed "Emma L.", "Marc D." and
 *     "Sophie R.", each with a generated face from i.pravatar.cc;
 *   - a hard-coded 4.5 star rating stamped on every real dish pulled from the
 *     restaurant's own catalogue;
 *   - two invented dishes ("Avocado Quinoa Bowl", "Mediterranean Salad Pie")
 *     carrying 4.7 and 4.8 ratings and Unsplash photography, rendered beside
 *     the real ones in the same card styling;
 *   - "4.9/5 Average Rating" and "10K+ Happy Customers" tiles;
 *   - an About page defaulting to "10K+ clients satisfaits" and a "4.9/5 note
 *     moyenne".
 *
 * The homepage block exposed only a badge and a section title, so none of it
 * was reachable from the admin: removing invented reviews from a restaurant's
 * own site required an engine code change. The product has no reviews table
 * and no ratings table — nothing collects a rating, so any star it draws is a
 * literal somebody typed.
 *
 * The tests read the shipped source off disk rather than rendering it,
 * because the defect was the presence of the data, not the behaviour of a
 * component: a guard that only fired at runtime would pass on a page nobody
 * mounted in a test.
