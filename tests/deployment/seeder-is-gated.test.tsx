/**
 * The kitchen seeder is offered to the role that may actually run it (#523).
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `SeedKitchenButton` gated on `if (!storeId) return null` and
 * nothing else, so « Créer commandes test » and « Nettoyer test » rendered for
 * every role on every client site, beside the real tickets on a working kitchen
 * display. `seedKitchenOrders` and `cleanKitchenSeed` are `storeMutation`s on
 * `kitchen:manage`, which no client role holds, so an owner or a cook who
 * pressed one was shown a control and then refused by a toast.
 *
 * WHY THE BUTTON IS GATED RATHER THAN DELETED FROM THE TEMPLATE. Deleting it
 * looked simpler and costs more. `convex/` is held byte-identical across the
 * two apps by `check-app-divergence`, so both mutations ship to every client
 * deployment either way; removing only the button leaves them callerless, which
 * `tests/convex/public-surface.test.ts` refuses — and the one way past that test
 * is its kept-callerless list, which its own comment requires to be identical in
 * both apps because the bench DOES call them. Recording the exception would
 * therefore have meant diverging a guard file between the twins, which is the
 * asymmetry that lets drift in.
 *
 * A control that appears exactly for whoever the server will serve is the
 * smaller change and the more honest screen. The gate is the same permission
 * the mutation checks, so the two cannot disagree.
