/**
 * A delivered restaurant site must not trust a development origin.
 *
 * `convex/auth.ts` has carried a comment saying exactly that — "un site client
 * n'a aucune raison d'accepter une origine de développement" — while the line
 * underneath it appended `http://localhost:3000` to every deployment, this
 * one included. A comment is not a control. This is the control.
 *
 * WHY IT READS THE SOURCE. Both files build their config at module scope
 * against `process.env`, and `convex/auth.ts` pulls in the Better Auth Convex
 * component, which needs a Convex runtime to import at all. What can be
 * checked without one is the thing that actually went wrong: a hard-coded dev
 * origin in the list. So this asserts on the text, and asserts the ONE shape
 * that is still allowed — a dev origin reachable only when the build is not a
 * production build.
