/**
 * Where this test tree is standing, and what it is allowed to see from there.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN. These suites ship. `scripts/lib/mirror-tree.mjs` copies
 * every git-tracked file under `apps/themes` onto
 * `be-in-digital/beyours-boilerplate`, `tests/` included, and rule 9 of
 * `CLAUDE.md` tells every client to run `pnpm test` before they commit. Four
 * of those shipped files reached ABOVE the application root — `path.join(APP,
 * "../..")`, `new URL("../../../docs/…")` — for things that exist only in this
 * monorepo: `packages/`, the root `scripts/`, `apps/docs/`, the sibling app.
 *
 * A client has none of them, and the two ways that failed were not equally
 * visible:
 *
 *   LOUD  — `readFileSync` on a path that is not there. The file did not
 *           collect, and `tests/deployment/ses-feedback-provisioning.test.ts`
 *           and `tests/convex/nightly-backup.test.ts` died on
 *           ENOENT '/home/runner/work/beyours-boilerplate/themes/scripts/setup-aws.sh'.
 *
 *   QUIET — a scan root that simply is not there. `public-surface.test.ts`
 *           walks its caller roots with an `existsSync` guard that returns an
 *           empty list, so `packages/` being absent did not error: it reported
 *           the 79 public Convex functions whose callers live in the engine as
 *           having no caller at all. A number, not a crash, and wrong.
 *
 * Measured on the tree at `a7862e90`, materialised the way the publisher
 * materialises it: `Test Files 3 failed | 140 passed`. The boilerplate's own
 * CI had been red since 7 September for exactly this.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR. One place that answers "am I in the engine
 * monorepo, or am I a delivered client site", positively and once, so no
 * individual test has to guess from a missing file. A test that needs
 * something only the monorepo has asks for it here and gets `null` in a client
 * site; a test that needs the ENGINE — which a client does have, installed
 * under `node_modules/@be-in-digital/` rather than checked out under
 * `packages/` — gets it in both.
 *
 * `__tests__/client-stylesheet.test.ts` reached the same answer first, by hand,
 * and its docblock states the rule this module implements: "This file ships
 * too … so it has to obey the rule it enforces." It is the precedent, not a
 * duplicate — it guards the stylesheet's own `@source` paths, which is a
 * different question about the same boundary.
 *
 * The distinction is deliberate and is not "skip it if the file is missing".
 * A missing file is exactly what a genuine regression looks like, so a suite
 * that shrugs at one guards nothing. The question asked here is about the
 * SHAPE OF THE CHECKOUT, which is answered before any assertion runs and
 * cannot be satisfied by deleting something.

/**
 * Every directory holding ENGINE code, wherever this checkout keeps it.
 *
 * The engine is present in both layouts and that is what separates it from
 * everything above: a client installs `@be-in-digital/*` from GitHub Packages,
 * so the code that calls a Convex function is under
 * `node_modules/@be-in-digital/` there and under `packages/` here. Same code,
 * two addresses.
 *
 * `sources` is what to walk. `includesBuildOutput` says whether `dist/` is
 * among them, and the two callers need opposite answers:
 *
 *   monorepo  — walk the sources, skip `dist`. It is build output, generated
 *               from the `src` next to it, so it adds no reference the walk has
 *               not already seen — and a STALE one would add references that no
 *               longer exist, hiding precisely what such a scan is looking for.
 *
 *   installed — walk everything the package ships, `dist` included. Four engine
 *               packages publish raw `src/*.ts` and four publish only `dist`
 *               (`core` publishes both), so skipping build output here would
 *               drop half the engine on the floor and re-create the silent
 *               undercount this module documents.
 *
 * Measured, because "the two agree" is the only thing that makes this
 * substitution honest: run against `apps/themes/convex` at `a7862e90`, the
 * monorepo roots and the installed roots each leave the SAME ten public
 * functions without a caller — the ten on `public-surface.test.ts`'s
 * `KEPT_CALLERLESS` list, and no others. Scanning what a client installs is
 * not an approximation of scanning `packages/`; here it is the same answer.
