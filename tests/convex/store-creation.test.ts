/**
 * Creating an establishment from the dashboard (#125).
 *
 * On a product billed per store, this is the central commercial gesture, and
 * it threw on every attempt. `stores.create` declares six fields — `name`,
 * `slug`, `description`, `address`, `phone`, `email` — and the create dialog
 * sent a seventh: a `settings` object holding currency, timezone, service
 * toggles, fees and a tax rate. Convex rejects an undeclared argument instead
 * of dropping it, so the mutation never ran and the dialog only ever showed
 * "Échec de la création de l'établissement". The only stores that existed came
 * from `seedFixture`.
 *
 * The unit suites could not see this: they call the handler directly, past the
 * validator. These tests go through the real Convex function, the real
 * validator and the real schema, which is the seam that broke.
 *
 * `STORE_CREATE_PAYLOAD` is the dashboard's payload, field for field. If
 * `handleCreateStore` ever grows a field again, this file is where it has to
 * be declared first.

 * pending; whatever fires them next writes against a transaction that closed,
 * and because nothing awaits it that arrives as an unhandled rejection. The run
 * then reports every test green and still exits 1, blaming whichever file
 * happened to be running rather than the one that queued the work.

 * `_scheduled_functions` row on completion, an action has no transaction to
 * patch it in, and the failure comes straight back. Finishing the queue with
 * `finishAllScheduledFunctions` was tried first and made it worse — ten
