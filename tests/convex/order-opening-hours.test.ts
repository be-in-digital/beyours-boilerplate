/**
 * The restaurant's opening hours, enforced where they can hold.
 *
 * `isOrderableStore` answers for the status an owner sets by hand and says so
 * itself: hours are "a separate question, answered in the storefront". Nothing
 * flips `status` on a schedule — there is no such cron — so the weekly week the
 * dashboard writes was honoured by exactly one thing: a `toast.error` on the
 * checkout page. A tab left open past closing, a cart restored from
 * localStorage, or a direct call to the mutation each produced an order at 4
 * a.m. in an empty building.
 *
 * The rule itself is `isWithinBusinessHours` in `@be-in-digital/convex-schema`,
 * covered by `openingHours.test.ts` there — the same function `useStoreStatus`
 * calls, so the browser's toast and this refusal cannot drift apart. What is
 * held here is that the mutation actually asks it.
