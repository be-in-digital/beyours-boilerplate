/**
 * `listJobs` reads the right table, for the right establishment (#480, held
 * here since #532).
 *
 * WHAT ITS UNIT TESTS CANNOT SEE. `__tests__/translationJobs.test.ts` drives the
 * handler with a hand-written `ctx`:
 *
 *     query: () => ({ withIndex: () => ({ take: async (n) => rows.slice(0, n) }) })
 *
 * `query` ignores the table name and `withIndex` ignores both the index and the
 * range. So the handler returns the fixture whatever it asks for — measured by
 * #532, which pointed `listJobs` at the wrong table and watched every case stay
 * green. Those cases are good at what they do, which is the SHAPING: the fields
 * returned, the ordering, the clamping, the row written before `error` existed.
 * They cannot speak for the two things a fake `ctx` defines away.
 *
 * So this file drives the same handler through `convex-test`, against the real
 * schema, where `ctx.db.query("translationJobs")` means that table and
 * `by_storeId` means that index. Two facts, and they are the two a wrong query
 * would break first: the runs come from `translationJobs`, and they come from
 * ONE establishment.
 *
 * The second is not hypothetical. A chain runs one deployment per client but
 * several establishments inside it, and a back-fill is per establishment — so a
 * query that dropped the store bound would show the Lyon kitchen's German
 * translation run on the Paris languages screen, with a « 80 / 300 » nobody
 * there can act on.
