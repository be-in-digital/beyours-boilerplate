/**
 * The checkout and the card tile answer the same question the same way.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. Not a bug — a coincidence. `stripe.createCheckoutSession`
 * refuses a `connected` Stripe connection through `assertChargeableOnPlatform`,
 * and `paymentAvailability.get` greys the card tile for the same state, and
 * the two agree only because each calls `resolveStripeCharge` on its own. There
 * was nothing holding them together. Change either call site — add a status to
 * the refusal, read a different row, move the check behind the SDK import — and
 * the storefront offers a tile every diner is walked into and turned away from,
 * one at a time, with no `cardProviderHealth` row to explain it (there cannot
 * be one: the refusal happens before any call to Stripe, so no verdict about
 * our credentials exists, and the hourly `verifyStripeKey` probe cannot help
 * because the key itself is fine).
 *
 * Measured at `b9e20ea` before writing this: a `connected` row with a
 * well-formed `sk_` key answers `{ card: false, cardOffered: true }` — the
 * tile is greyed and the establishment still says it takes cards, which is the
 * pair of facts that state deserves. What follows is the assertion that it
 * stays that way, over EVERY status the schema admits rather than the one that
 * happens to fail today.
