/**
 * The verifier a client runs, and what its logs are allowed to carry.
 *
 * TWO FINDINGS OF #433, both invisible to every test that existed.
 *
 * **The hardened verifier was dead code (#433.2).**
 *
 *     $ grep -rn "verifyWebhookSignature" packages apps --include='*.ts' \
 *         | grep -v __tests__ | grep -v /dist/
 *     packages/integrations/src/deliveroo/security.ts:44:export async function …
 *     apps/themes/e2e/deliveroo/webhook-signing.test.ts:59
 *     apps/reference/e2e/deliveroo/webhook-signing.test.ts:59
 *
 * Only the two test files imported it. The delivered route had its own copy,
 * which dropped the package's hex-format check and its 64-character length
 * check and stripped a `sha256=` prefix the package deliberately refuses. So
 * `webhook-signing.test.ts`'s docblock — *"The real verifier and the real
 * route … put in front of the code that will judge it in production"* — was
 * false of the tree it ran on. The suite proved a function no client executed.
 *
 * **The debug logging printed the diner's allergy note (#433.3).** Four
 * `[Sync Debug]` lines were unconditional and compiled into the artefact
 * `convex deploy` produces, and one of them printed `note="…"` — free text the
 * codebase documents elsewhere as a food-safety path. Health data, into a
 * client's Convex log, on every Deliveroo order.
 *
 * These are source assertions rather than behavioural ones, deliberately. Both
 * defects are about which code the delivered tree contains: a behavioural test
 * of the route passes identically whether the route verifies with its own copy
 * or with the package's, which is exactly why neither was caught.
