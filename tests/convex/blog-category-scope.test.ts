/**
 * An article cannot be filed under another establishment's rubric (#112).
 *
 * THE HOLE. `generateArticle` is guarded — `_reserveQuota` checks `content:write`
 * on `storeId` — and that check says nothing about `categoryId`, which arrives as
 * a separate argument. A caller holding `content:write` on their own
 * establishment could pass another one's `blogCategories` id, and the article was
 * written with it. The manual editor had the same door.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY BROKE, measured rather than assumed. Not a listing leak:
 * `listByCategory` is keyed on `storeId` + `publishedCategoryId`, so the other
 * establishment's blog never surfaces the article. Two things do go wrong:
 *
 *   - `getArticleBySlug` resolves the category with a bare `ctx.db.get` and
 *     renders `category.name` on the public page — so another establishment's
 *     rubric name appears on this one's blog.
 *   - The article is unreachable from its own category listing, because that
 *     listing resolves rubrics by `by_storeId_slug`. Published, and filed under
 *     nothing.
