/**
 * The anonymous prize drain (#323, source card NEW-N).
 *
 * `gamePlay.play` is public and anonymous on purpose — the whole product is a
 * diner scanning a QR code at a table — and its only fairness mechanism was a
 * 24h cooldown keyed on `args.fingerprint`, a string the browser sends. So the
 * loop below used to empty a restaurant's prize budget: 40 calls changing
 * nothing but that string, 0 refused, a five-prize stock at zero.
 *
 * These tests drive the real public mutation through the real schema and the
 * real `rateLimits` table, because that is the seam the card measured. The
 * unit suite in `packages/convex-functions` calls the same handlers past a
 * hand-rolled `db` mock, which cannot show that the limiter's index exists.
 *
 * #NEW-N closed the residual those windows left open. Two guards were added and
 * both are pinned below: an establishment-wide PRIZE BUDGET (the windows bound
 * how often the endpoint is called, never how much it gives away — 500 calls
 * over 40 table codes still issued 200 prizes in an hour), and server-side
 * enforcement of the store's REQUIRED ACTIONS (`completedActions` was written
 * to the row and never read to permit anything, so a caller sending `[]` won a
 * prize while the store required a Google review).
 *
 * One case here was REWRITTEN rather than kept. "what this does NOT fix: the
 * stock still empties" asserted the defect as settled behaviour. It is still
 * true of a stock smaller than the budget in force, and that half survives
 * below with its reasoning intact — but it is no longer true of the store as a
 * whole, and an owner can now set a budget that protects a small stock. A test
 * that blessed the old ceiling would have hidden the new one.
