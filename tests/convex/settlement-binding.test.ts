/**
 * Every entry point that marks an order paid must first prove the payment

 *
 * This is a source-level check, not a behavioural one, and it is the only kind

 *
 * THE BUG: `stripe.ts` carried the annotation "assertSettlesOrder binds the
 * session to this order, currency and amount". The module had zero imports of
 * `assertSettlesOrder` and zero calls to it. The comment was the only thing
 * that made the guard look present — a reviewer reading the file, and the
 * audit that produced the annotation, both took it at its word.
 *
 * A behavioural test cannot reach this. `stripe.ts`, `sumup.ts` and `paypal.ts`
 * are all `"use node"` and dynamically import provider SDKs, so none of them
 * loads under the `edge-runtime` environment these suites run in. The guard's
 * own logic is unit-tested in
 * `packages/convex-functions/src/__tests__/paymentSettlement.test.ts`; what is
 * asserted here is that the four call sites actually reach it.
 *
 * Comments are stripped before matching. The first version of this detector was
 * written without that step and passed against `stripe.ts` — because the lying
 * comment contains the word it was looking for.
