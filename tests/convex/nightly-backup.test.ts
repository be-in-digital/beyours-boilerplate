 * The nightly backup runs without a user, and lands somewhere that is not a
 * laptop.
 *
 * `grep backup` in `crons.ts` returned nothing. `exportBackup`'s only caller was
 * a button that built a Blob and triggered a browser download, and the function
 * could not be called from a cron at all: it opens with
 * `getAuthUserInternal`, which throws `"Not authenticated"` under a scheduled
 * job — the rule `crons.ts` states in its own header. So « Sauvegardes
 * automatiques quotidiennes de vos données et contenus » described a manual
 * export that happened when someone remembered. Issue #366.
 *
 * Two things are asserted, and the first is the one that made this impossible
 * before: the export core takes no identity, and the off-site write actually
 * puts bytes in the bucket.

 * The rehearsal runbook, read rather than remembered.
 *
 * Both apps resolve to the same file — it documents the drill, not either
 * app — and that is deliberate: a runbook whose commands nothing checks is a
 * runbook that quietly stops being true, and this one did. Its first inspection
 * command was `jq '{createdAt, deployedAppVersion, backupFormatVersion,
 * tableRowCounts}' backup.json`, against an object whose root is
 * `{ manifest, data }`. It returned four nulls, and `"tableRowCounts": null` is
 * what a good backup and a truncated one produce identically — while the step's
 * own prose makes that field the go/no-go gate. The very next line already
 * carried the `.manifest` prefix, which is why a read-through missed it.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY THAT MATTERS HERE. `apps/docs/deployment/` — above
 * this application, and therefore not in the tree a client receives. This file
 * SHIPS: the mirror copies every tracked file under `apps/themes` onto the
 * boilerplate, and rule 9 of `CLAUDE.md` tells the client to run `pnpm test`.
 * Read through `new URL("../../../docs/…")` it resolved, on a client's machine,
 * to a path outside their repository, and the whole file — the nightly backup
 * assertions below included — died on collection with
 * ENOENT '/home/runner/work/beyours-boilerplate/docs/deployment/backup-restore-rehearsal.md'.
 *
 * The runbook is the agency's document about the agency's drill. A client has
 * no copy of it and nothing to fix if it is wrong, so this block is scoped to
 * the engine checkout — by `monorepoPath`, which answers from the SHAPE of the
 * checkout, not from whether the file happens to be readable. Delete the
 * runbook in this repository and `readFileSync` still throws, loudly, which is
 * the property worth keeping.
