/**
 * `soundConfig` reaches the kitchen display through the real mutation (#224).
 *
 * The audit listed it beside `orderConfirmation` and `displayConfig` as a dead
 * setting — "mutations and audit entries wired, with no reader or writer" — and
 * 74de4e9 deleted the mutations for the other two on the strength of that.
 *
 * The claim was wrong about all three, and the note this file used to carry
 * repeated it. `soundConfig` is read by `KitchenContent`, which hands it to
 * `KitchenSoundManager` in both apps on the routed `/dashboard/orders/kitchen`
 * screen. `orderConfirmation` is read by `releaseToKitchen`. `displayConfig` is
 * read by `kitchenTickets.getForDisplay`, and always was — the dining-room
 * screen has been applying it since it shipped. Both mutations are back;
 * `kitchen-display-config.test.ts` holds the second one to the same standard as
 * this file holds this one.
 *
 * This test exists so the claim is checked rather than remembered. It writes
 * through the real mutation and reads back through `stores.getById` — the query
 * the KDS uses — so the write and the read are the same seam the kitchen runs
 * on.

 * pending; whatever fires them next writes against a transaction that closed,
 * and because nothing awaits it that arrives as an unhandled rejection. The run
 * then reports every test green and still exits 1, blaming whichever file
 * happened to be running rather than the one that queued the work.
 *
 * Cancel rather than run. `syncAllStores` is an `internalAction`, and running
 * one here is the disease, not the cure: convex-test patches its
 * `_scheduled_functions` row on completion, an action has no transaction to
 * patch it in, and the failure comes straight back. Finishing the queue with
 * `finishAllScheduledFunctions` was tried first and made it worse — ten
 * rejections in a run where leaving the jobs alone produced two.
