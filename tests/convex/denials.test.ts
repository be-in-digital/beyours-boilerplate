/**
 * Refusals the UI can act on.
 *
 * `ConvexError` appeared nowhere in this repository. Every guard threw a plain
 * `Error`, Convex redacts those in production, and the UI rendered
 * `error.message` — so a kitchen account opening the settings screen, an owner
 * whose profile was never provisioned, and a genuine backend fault all produced
 * "Server Error". Every authorisation answer looked like a bug in the product.
 *
 * These tests pin the codes. They are a contract between the guards and the
 * screens that switch on them, and prose in a `message` is not one.

 * every catalogue write. A test finishes in milliseconds and leaves them
 * pending; whatever fires them next writes against a transaction that closed,
 * and because nothing awaits it that arrives as an unhandled rejection. The run
 * then reports every test green and still exits 1, blaming whichever file
 * happened to be running rather than the one that queued the work.
 *
 * Cancel rather than run. `syncAllStores` is an `internalAction`, and running
 * one here is the disease, not the cure: convex-test patches its
 * `_scheduled_functions` row on completion, an action has no transaction to
 * patch it in, and the failure comes straight back. Finishing the queue with
 * `finishAllScheduledFunctions` was tried first and made it worse — ten
 * rejections in a run where leaving the jobs alone produced two.
