/**
 * A backend error reaching somebody who can act on it.
 *
 * Until this existed, it did not. The only trace of a failure inside a Convex
 * function was one of 112 `console.error` calls in `apps/reference/convex`, and
 * a Convex log line lands in the dashboard of ONE client's deployment. With one
 * deployment per client, a Saturday-night order that failed in a webhook was
 * seen by nobody at BeYours, and finding it meant opening each client's console
 * in turn — while the maintenance contract sells support.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the property, not the plumbing: an error that occurs
 * inside a Convex function ends up as an HTTP request to Sentry's ingestion
 * endpoint, correctly addressed and with the credentials stripped out of it.
 * `packages/core/src/sentry/__tests__/envelope.test.ts` proves the wire format
 * in isolation; this proves it is actually reached from the runtime that has
 * the errors.
 *
 * The reporter is also the one piece of code that must never fail: it runs
 * inside `catch` blocks, and an exception raised there would replace the
 * original fault with its own. Half of this file is about that.
