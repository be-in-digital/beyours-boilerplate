/**
 * Every publicly registered Convex function is called by something.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN. This app registered **359** public Convex functions and
 * **81** of them had no caller anywhere — no screen, no package, no test, no
 * script, no cron. A registered public function is reachable by anyone holding
 * the deployment URL whether or not a screen calls it, so each one was an
 * unreviewed, untested surface on every client's backend. Eleven were
 * unauthenticated storefront reads (`products.getFeatured`, `products.getBySlug`,
 * `products.getByCategory`, `cms.getPage`, `menus.getById`, `categories.getById`,
 * two blog listings, two translation reads, and `orders.getByViewToken`) whose
 * live siblings — `products.list`, `cms.getPageBlocks`, `orders.getById` — are
 * what the storefront actually opens. #281 is the precedent for what one of
 * these becomes when it takes its identity from its caller.
 *
 * The sweep confirmed none of the 81 was an unguarded write, so this was never
 * an open door. It was surface, and surface is what gets found later.
 *
 * WHY THE ISSUE'S OWN COUNT WAS WRONG. #413 said 36. That number comes from
 * looking only at bare `query(`/`mutation(`/`action(`, which misses the 200
 * exports built with `storeQuery`/`storeMutation`/`authedQuery`/`authedMutation`
 * — and those are *also* public registrations: `lib/storeFunctions.ts` binds
 * them to the generated `query`/`mutation` builders, so they are routed exactly
 * as publicly and merely permission-checked inside. Counting them gives 81.
 *
 * A caller sweep also has to allow for optional chaining. `packages/admin`
 * receives the API as `api: any` through `stores/admin-api-store.ts` and calls
 * `api?.products?.list`; a scan for `api\.x\.y` alone reports 132 dead where
 * there are 81, and would have deleted live screens' backends.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. Having a caller is not the same as being safe or
 * being tested. This test closes one hole only: a function that is reachable by
 * the whole internet and reached by nothing in this repository.
