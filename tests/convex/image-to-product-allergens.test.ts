/**
 * What the AI extractor is allowed to write into `products.allergens`.
 *
 * `imageToProduct.analyze` is the only thing in production that fills that
 * field without a human typing the value. It used to ask GPT, in French, for
 * "les allergènes très probables" and store the prose that came back, so the
 * database filled up with wordings that resolve against nothing — which is how
 * an unrecognised value got in front of a diner in the first place.
 *
 * Two properties are held here:
 *
 *   1. The prompt offers the model the canonical vocabulary rather than free
 *      prose, and offers it to BOTH vision paths (single dish and menu photo).
 *   2. Whatever comes back is resolved through the one vocabulary before it is
 *      stored — and a value that still does not resolve is kept, not dropped.
