/**
 * What the provider tells us after the checkout is over.
 *
 * THE BUG: the Stripe webhook understood one event, `checkout.session.completed`,
 * and answered 200 to the rest. Two of the discarded four are money.
 *
 *  - A guest who pays and closes the tab never reaches the confirmation page.
 *    If the checkout delivery is lost as well, the charge sits in Stripe behind
 *    an order at `paymentStatus: "pending"`: money taken, kitchen blind, and
 *    nothing that would ever notice. `payment_intent.succeeded` is the second
 *    chance, and the reconciliation sweep is the third — the one that works even
 *    when Stripe never delivered anything at all.
 *  - A refund issued from the Stripe dashboard moved real money and left our
 *    `refundedAmount` untouched. The admin accepts `partially_refunded` as a
 *    refundable state, so a stale balance is an operator being offered money
 *    that is no longer there. `planRefund` refuses the overshoot server-side, so
 *    nothing is lost twice — what the operator gets is an error about a balance
 *    no screen ever showed them.
 *
 * `stripeWebhook` is an `httpAction` calling a `"use node"` verifier that
 * imports the Stripe SDK, so neither loads under `edge-runtime`.
 * `stripe-event-coverage.test.ts` asserts against the source that the route
 * reaches these mutations; this file runs the mutations for real, against the
 * real schema, in memory.
