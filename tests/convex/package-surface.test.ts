/**
 * The reverse of `public-surface.test.ts` (#524).
 *
 * That file asks whether every function this app REGISTERS has a caller. This
 * one asks the other question, which nothing asked: whether every complete
 * Convex definition the engine package EXPORTS is wrapped by an app at all.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS. A `{ args, handler }` in `@be-in-digital/convex-functions` is
 * not reachable by anything until an app wraps it in `query`, `mutation` or one
 * of the guarded forms. Unwrapped, it compiles, it is covered by its unit tests,
 * it appears in the package's exports — and no screen, script or webhook can
 * call it. It is indistinguishable from a working feature except by looking.
 *
 * Three of them were features the product needed and nobody could reach:
 * `emailSegments.refreshCount` was the only writer of a real subscriber count,
 * so the campaign wizard read « 0 abonnés » for every segment ever made;
 * `blog.deleteTag` meant tags accumulated for the life of an establishment; and
 * `translations.bulkUpsert` could not be wrapped as written at all, its
 * `storeId` sitting inside each array element where no store guard can read it.
 *
 * WHAT THE LEDGER BELOW IS, AND IS NOT. It is every definition no app
 * references today, and it is NOT a list of approved ones — most have not been
 * looked at. Pinning it turns "how many are there?" from a question nobody was
 * asking into a number that cannot grow silently: a new unwrapped definition
 * fails, and wrapping one fails too until the entry comes out. Each entry that
 * gets judged should leave, either by being wrapped or by being deleted with
 * its reason, the way `cmsPublish.publishPage` and `translations.bulkUpsert`
 * were.
 *
 * WHY A NAME MATCH. The apps wrap through `blogDefs.deleteTag.handler` and
 * through a dozen other spellings, and a parser for all of them would be a
 * second implementation of the wrapping convention. A name that appears nowhere
 * in either app's `convex/` is unreachable whatever the spelling, which is the
 * direction this file needs to be exact in. The opposite error — a name that
 * collides with an unrelated identifier and reads as wrapped — makes the ledger
 * shorter than the truth, never longer, so it can hide an entry but never
 * invent one.

/*
 * WHY THIS SUITE DOES NOT RUN IN A DELIVERED SITE.
 *
 * It ships, like every file under `tests/`. It used to derive its roots as
 * `join(process.cwd(), "../..")` — an address only this monorepo has — and in
 * the tree a client receives that resolves to the directory ABOVE the
 * repository, so all five cases died on ENOENT and the mirror refused to sync.
 *
 * The right answer here is to stand down rather than to re-address, which makes
 * it the exception among its neighbours. `enginePackageFile` would find the
 * package half — `convex-functions` publishes `src`, so a client has it — but
 * the question this file asks is *is this definition wrapped by AN APP*, and
 * "an app" means `themes` AND `reference` together. A client has one, and the
 * `UNWRAPPED` ledger below was measured against both: read against one, every
 * definition the sibling wraps would read as unwrapped. That is not a failure a
 * client could act on — the ledger is the agency's, and so is the convention it
 * pins.
 *
 * `IN_MONOREPO` is a positive test for the engine checkout (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`
 * next to `packages/`), not "the file I wanted is missing" — a suite that
 * shrugged at a missing file would be the vacuum this ledger exists to refuse.
