/**
 * A "Stripe connected" row must not be able to lie again — ISSUE #162, sub-point 4.
 *
 * `convex/stripe.ts` builds its client from the PLATFORM secret key and sends no
 * `stripeAccount`, no `on_behalf_of` and no `transfer_data`, so every euro paid
 * by card lands in the platform balance. For a while the connect flow wrote
 * `paymentConnections.status: "connected"` the moment Stripe reported
 * `charges_enabled`, and the admin showed a green "Connecté" to an owner whose
 * takings were going somewhere else. The flow was corrected to write
 * `onboarding_complete`, the honest literal.
 *
 * Nothing stopped the next person writing `"connected"` again: `grep -c
 * paymentConnections convex/stripe.ts` returned 0 — the charge path never read
 * the row at all. These tests are the tripwire. `connected` is unreachable
 * today, so refusing it costs nothing and makes reintroducing the deception
 * impossible to do quietly.
 *
 * THE RULE IS NARROW, AND THE WIDE VERSION IS A TRAP. "Refuse whenever a Stripe
 * connection exists" would mean finishing Connect onboarding breaks card
 * payments outright for that restaurant. Only `connected` is refused; every
 * other state charges on the platform key exactly as before.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A SOURCE-LEVEL HALF: `stripe.ts` is `"use node"` and dynamically
 * imports the Stripe SDK. The behavioural half below does reach both money
 * paths, but it can only observe that they refused — not that they refused for
 * the right reason at the right moment, before anything is sent to Stripe. The
 * source check states that, and it strips comments before matching: the first
 * detector of this shape in this repository (`settlement-binding.test.ts`)
 * passed against a lying comment, because the comment contained the word it was
 * looking for.
