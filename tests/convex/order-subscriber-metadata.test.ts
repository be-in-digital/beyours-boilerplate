/**
 * An order confirming, and the segment that can finally find the customer.
 *
 * `updateMetadataIncremental` existed for this and had no caller anywhere, so
 * `totalOrders`, `totalSpent` and `lastOrderAt` were never written. The visible
 * cost was not in the automations that need them — it was the segment editor:
 * an owner could build "clients ayant dépensé plus de 100 €", attach it to a
 * campaign, and send to nobody, with no error to explain it.
 *
 * These go through the real `updateStatus` mutation rather than the shared
 * handler, because the claim is that every path into a status change carries
 * the order through — and then check the segment filter the owner would
 * actually write.
