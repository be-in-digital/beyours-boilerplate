/**
 * One order, at most one payable Stripe session — and a refusal the diner can
 * read.
 *
 * THE BUG (#411, B2-F1). `createCheckoutSession` overwrote the order's stored
 * session id and told Stripe nothing about the old one, which stays payable
 * for about twenty-four hours. A diner who opened checkout twice — a stale
 * tab, a back-navigation, a retry — therefore left TWO live sessions against
 * one order, and both could be completed. Both referenced the same order at
 * the same total in the same currency, and both were `card`, so no check on
 * the settlement side could separate them: a 1 200 € order collected 2 400 €.
 *
 * `payments.settlePayment` now refuses the second row, which keeps the ledger
 * honest. It does not make the diner whole — the money has already left their
 * account, and somebody has to give it back. These cases are the other half:
 * the second charge is never TAKEN.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, and both are needed. Expiring the previous session closes
 * the window on an order still waiting to be paid; refusing to open a checkout
 * on an order already collected closes it on one that has been. `orders.create`
 * is idempotent on the diner's key, so a resubmit lands on the SAME order —
 * which is what makes the second case reachable at all.
 *
 * THE OTHER DEFECT HERE (#411, B2-F8). A key Stripe rejects is well-formed, so
 * `paymentAvailability`'s `startsWith("sk_")` armed the card tile, and the
 * `StripeAuthenticationError` thrown by `sessions.create` is a plain `Error`
 * that Convex redacts to "Server Error" — the exact screen #374 was written to
 * remove, on the exact tile it was written to stop pre-selecting. The refusal
 * is now legible, and the verdict is recorded so the tile goes down for
 * everyone behind that diner.
