 * The price on the menu is the price charged.
 *
 * The server added VAT on top of it: a pizza shown at 12,00 € was billed
 * 14,40 € at the default rate of 20, under an order summary labelled "TVA
 * incluse". French B2C sale requires the displayed price to be the one paid, so
 * the tax is *extracted* from it — and the amount extracted follows each
 * product's own rate, a field the form has always collected and the order path
 * never read.
 *
 * Stripe charges `order.total` verbatim (`convex/stripe.ts`), so what this file
 * pins is the amount the card is debited.

 * — `scheduleMenuSync` puts the Uber Eats and Deliveroo syncs at a 5s delay on
 * every catalogue write. A test finishes in milliseconds and leaves them
 * pending; whatever fires them next writes against a transaction that closed,
 * and because nothing awaits it that arrives as an unhandled rejection. The run
 * then reports every test green and still exits 1, blaming whichever file
 * happened to be running rather than the one that queued the work.
 *
 * Cancel rather than run. `syncAllStores` is an `internalAction`, and running
 * one here is the disease, not the cure: convex-test patches its
 * `_scheduled_functions` row on completion, an action has no transaction to
 * patch it in, and the failure comes straight back. Finishing the queue with
 * `finishAllScheduledFunctions` was tried first and made it worse — ten
 * rejections in a run where leaving the jobs alone produced two.
