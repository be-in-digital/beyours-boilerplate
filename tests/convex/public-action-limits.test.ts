/**
 * What a storefront visitor can spend of the restaurant's money without a
 * session.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN (#430.5). Every public-by-design *mutation* in this
 * deployment was bounded and every public-by-design **action** was not:
 *
 * ```
 * $ for f in uberDirect stripe sumup paypal; do
 *     printf "%-12s %s\n" $f $(grep -c consumeRateLimit convex/$f.ts); done
 * uberDirect   0
 * stripe       0
 * sumup        0
 * paypal       0
 * ```
 *
 * Not an oversight in one file — a consequence of how the limiter is built.
 * `consumeRateLimit` reads and writes the `rateLimits` table, deliberately in
 * the same transaction as the write it protects, and an action has no
 * `ctx.db` at all. So the bound could not be written where these callers are,
 * and was not written anywhere.
 *
 * The actions are the expensive half. Each of the five below is reachable with
 * no account — they have to be, a diner sees a delivery fee and pays before
 * they have one — and each calls a third party the restaurant is billed by or
 * quota'd by. A script could burn an establishment's Uber Direct quota until
 * real deliveries stopped being quotable, at no cost to whoever ran it.
 *
 * These drive the registered actions with no identity, which is how they are
 * reached, and assert the refusal arrives BEFORE the provider is called.
