/**
 * Draft establishments must not be storefronts.
 *
 * `stores.create` opens every new establishment in `draft`, and `stores.list` —
 * the query behind the selector page, the header dropdown, the automatic
 * selection and the sitemap — returned it alongside the published ones. A
 * restaurant whose owner had not finished setting it up was offered to
 * visitors with an active "Commander ici" button, and could take a real order
 * into a kitchen that was not waiting for it.
 *
 * These tests run the real Convex functions against the real schema, in memory.
 * They pin both halves of the rule: what the public list must not return, and
 * what the order mutation must refuse — because a list is only a list, and a
 * stale tab or a persisted selection reaches the mutation without it.
 *
 * The mirror assertions matter as much: the admin still sees its drafts, and
 * the kitchen role still reads the list `StoreGuard` renders the KDS behind.
