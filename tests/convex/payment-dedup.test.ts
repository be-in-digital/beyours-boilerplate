/**
 * One provider charge is one payment row.
 *
 * THE BUG: two writers settle the same Stripe charge from two different events
 * — the return page (`stripe.verifyCheckoutSession`) and the webhook
 * (`stripeWebhook.handleWebhook`). Each read `order.paymentStatus !== "paid"`
 * and then wrote, in separate transactions, so the loser of that race still
 * inserted. `by_externalId` existed on the payments table and a repository-wide
 * search found exactly one reference to it: its own definition.
 *
 * Every call site wrapped the insert in `try {} catch {}` under the comment
 * "Payment record may already exist". That comment was false — `db.insert` has
 * no duplicate to throw on — and the four `catch` blocks caught nothing.
 *
 * The consequence was not cosmetic: `planRefund` validates each row against its
 * OWN amount, so one 48 € charge recorded twice offered 96 € of refundable
 * balance. That is money out of the restaurant's account.
 *
 * These run the real Convex functions against the real schema, in memory.
