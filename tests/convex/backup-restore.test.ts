/**
 * A restored backup keeps its catalogue attached to its establishment (#224).
 *
 * `importTable` deletes a table and re-inserts its rows without their `_id` —
 * Convex will not let an insert choose one. So `stores` came back under **new**
 * ids while the products, menus, CMS pages and promotions restored after them
 * came back carrying the **old** `storeId`. Nothing objected: on a real
 * deployment `v.id("stores")` validates how an id is encoded, not that it
 * resolves. The deployment came up with every catalogue detached from its
 * establishment, and the owner's `userProfiles.storeIds` naming stores that no
 * longer existed — so they were locked out of every screen. Silently, and
 * irreversibly.
 *
 * Every id here is one this deployment actually issued: the fixture is seeded,
 * read back the way `exportTable` reads it, and fed to the import. That is the
 * real cycle, and it is the only way the ids survive the schema validator.
