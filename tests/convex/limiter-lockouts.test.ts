/**
 * The limiter must not become the attack (#323, adversarial round).
 *
 * A Convex mutation is a transaction. When a handler throws, every write it
 * made is rolled back — the limiter row included. So metering a path that
 * THROWS costs nothing and buys nothing, and the first round of #323 spent all
 * its care there. The paths that RETURN are the opposite: they commit, so a
 * slot spent on one is spent for real, and two of them were metered.
 *
 * Both were live denials of service against the restaurant, introduced by the
 * fix rather than found by it:
 *
 * - 60 replays of one already-claimed `playId`, with 60 invented addresses,
 *   emptied `gameClaimPerStore` and told the next genuine winner standing at
 *   the counter to come back in an hour.
 * - 100 calls to `ensureReferralCode` from a single browser tab — an endpoint
 *   that is idempotent by design and called on every visit — emptied
 *   `gameReferralPerStore` and refused a code to every diner after it.
 *
 * These run through `convex-test` and not the package's mock `db` on purpose:
 * the mock does not roll back, so it cannot tell the two kinds of path apart
 * and would have said both designs were fine.
