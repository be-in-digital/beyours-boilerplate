/**
 * Every variable the Convex tree reads is one an operator can provision (#502,
 * held here since #532).
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS, measured once already. `convex/system.ts` reads
 * `ENGINE_RELEASE_PACKUMENT_URL` and `ENGINE_RELEASE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` to tell an
 * operator which engine version they could move to, and neither key was
 * declared anywhere — not in `packages/core/src/env/schemas.ts`, not in the
 * provisioning manifest. `infisical-bootstrap.mjs migrate` refuses an
 * out-of-spec key, so there was **no documented way to provision the feed at
 * all**: the Système screen reported "unconfigured" on every deployment, and the
 * only way to learn the two names was to read the source.
 *
 * WHAT #532 FOUND. Removing the schema entry and the manifest entry together
 * left every suite green — 12/12, 46/46, 27/27. Nothing compared what the code
 * READS against what the tooling can SET, so the fix was held by nothing and
 * the same gap could reopen on the next variable.
 *
 * WHY A SWEEP AND NOT TWO ASSERTIONS. The defect is not about those two names;
 * it is about the class. A variable read inside Convex and declared nowhere is
 * unprovisionable whichever one it is, and the failure is silent — the feature
 * reports itself unconfigured for ever, on every deployment, and looks like a
 * feature nobody finished.
 *
 * BOTH LISTS, because they answer different questions. `schemas.ts` is what
 * `instrumentation.ts` validates at boot; `manifest.ts` is what the provisioning
 * tooling will accept. A name in one and not the other is provisionable and
 * unvalidated, or validated and unprovisionable.
