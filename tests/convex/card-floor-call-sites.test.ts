/**
 * Every path that opens a card charge asks the floor first.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN. `assertCardChargeable` refuses an amount no card provider
 * will take — below the provider minimum, zero, negative, not a number — before
 * one is asked to. Its own docblock names the three callers:
 *
 *     Called by `stripe.createCheckoutSession`, `sumup.createCheckout` and
 *     `paypal.createPayPalOrder`.
 *
 * Nothing checked that. The function had a thorough unit suite in
 * `packages/convex-functions/src/__tests__/cardChargeFloor.test.ts` — which
 * proves the rule and says nothing about whether anybody applies it — and the
 * call sites had no guard at all. Measured on this tree: replacing the call in
 * `stripe.createCheckoutSession` with a comment left `apps/themes/tests/convex`
 * at **82 files, 1181 tests, all green**.
 *
 * That is the identical shape `settlement-binding.test.ts` was written for, one
 * guard over: an annotation claiming a protection, in a module that had stopped
 * applying it. A caller list that lives only in prose is a caller list nothing
 * maintains.
 *
 * WHY SOURCE ASSERTIONS. `stripe.ts`, `sumup.ts` and `paypal.ts` are all
 * `"use node"` and dynamically import provider SDKs, so none of them loads
 * under the `edge-runtime` environment these suites run in. The rule's own
 * logic is unit-tested where it lives; what is asserted here is that the three
 * call sites actually reach it.
 *
 * Comments are stripped before matching, because the defect being guarded
 * against IS a comment that names the guard.
