/**
 * What a backup carries, checked against the schema rather than against memory.
 *
 * The export order and the import allow-list used to be written out twice, in
 * two files, and agree by hand. Between them they named **22 of this schema's
 * 77 tables**: no `orders`, no `payments`, no `kitchenTickets`, no
 * `translations`, and none of the sixteen `cms*` singletons — so a "backup" of
 * a restaurant's website did not contain that website's pages, and a restore
 * reached zero orders. The maintenance fee was sold on « Sauvegardes
 * automatiques quotidiennes de vos données et contenus ». Issues #169, #366.
 *
 * Three properties are asserted here, and each one is a way that list rots:
 *
 *  1. **Every table is classified.** A table added to the schema and to no list
 *     is silently absent from every backup — which is exactly how the sixteen
 *     CMS singletons happened.
 *  2. **The import order is a topological sort of the real foreign-key graph.**
 *     Derived from the schema's own validators, so a new `v.id()` field that
 *     breaks the order fails here rather than during someone's restore.
 *  3. **The fiscal archive is exported and never re-inserted.** `invoices.ts`
 *     states the rule in the schema itself (art. 242 nonies A CGI).
