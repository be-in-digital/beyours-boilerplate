/**
 * CSRF state on the payment connect callbacks — ISSUE #162, sub-point 3.
 *
 * Three HTTP routes took a provider redirect and acted on it with nothing to
 * prove the redirect was ours. The worst was `/connect/sumup/callback`: it read
 * `code` out of the query string and handed it straight to the SumUp token
 * exchange, which upserts `paymentConnections` with `status: "connected"`. An
 * injected authorization code therefore bound a THIRD PARTY's SumUp merchant
 * account to the restaurant, and the restaurant's card takings followed it.
 * `/connect/stripe/callback` wrote whatever `account_id` it was given, and
 * `/connect/stripe/refresh` minted a live Stripe onboarding link for any
 * account id that could be named.
 *
 * The infrastructure to stop this already existed and was used correctly by
 * `uberEatsOAuthHttp.ts` — these routes simply never called it.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS ASSERT ON THE REDIRECT MESSAGE, NOT ONLY ON THE ABSENT ROW:
 *
 * "No `paymentConnections` row was written" is green whether the callback was
 * refused or ran all the way into the exchange and failed there for want of
 * `SUMUP_CLIENT_ID` — and this environment has no credentials, so that
 * assertion passes against the UNFIXED code. It was measured doing exactly
 * that. The load-bearing assertion is therefore the error the browser is
 * redirected to: "Missing OAuth state" and "Invalid or expired OAuth state" can
 * only be produced by the state gate, so seeing one is proof the request was
 * stopped BEFORE the exchange. The absent row is kept as a second, weaker
 * witness rather than the primary one.
 *
 * `guards the guard` at the bottom exists for the same reason: four refusals
 * would also be green if `consume` refused everything, which would break the
 * real flow while looking perfect here.
