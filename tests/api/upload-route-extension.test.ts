/**
 * What extension the write half of the storage policy stores a file under.
 *
 * The route kept its own six-entry MIME-to-extension map while
 * `@be-in-digital/cms`'s `MIME_TO_EXT` — which calls itself the single source
 * of truth and is what the presigned Convex flow uses — held twelve. Anything
 * the shared list knew and the copy did not fell through to `"bin"`, and
 * `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES.cms` admits six such types: mp4, webm, and the three
 * Office documents, plus gif elsewhere. So the CMS media library offered a
 * video upload, accepted it, and wrote `cms/<uuid>.bin`.
 *
 * Two maps where one of them is authoritative is not a tidiness problem: the
 * one an upload actually goes through was the wrong one.
