/**
 * What the SERVER enforces on a dish photograph (#495, held here since #532).
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. #532 inverted #495: `maxSizeMB` in
 * `ProductImagesField` changed from 5 to 50, every suite run, all green. The
 * reason is worth stating plainly rather than fixing by tightening a number —
 * **that constant is client-side decoration.** So is the `accept` attribute
 * beside it. Both live in the browser:
 *
 *   - `accept` filters the file PICKER and nothing else. A drag-and-drop, a
 *     paste, or anything that is not the picker dialog walks past it.
 *   - `maxSizeMB` is checked in `ImageUploader.validateFile`, in the page.
 *
 * Neither reaches the route. `/api/upload` enforces `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` and
 * `MAX_FILE_SIZES` from `@be-in-digital/core`, and nothing exercised either for
 * the `products` folder. That is the gap: the field advertises three types and
 * five megabytes, the server admits five types and ten.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, stated because it was measured. `MAX_FILE_SIZES` and
 * `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` reach both the route and this file from
 * `@be-in-digital/core`'s `dist`, not its `src`. Editing `packages/core/src`
 * changes neither until the package is rebuilt — verified: raising
 * `products` to 50MB in `src` left all nineteen cases green. What these cases
 * hold is the route's ENFORCEMENT, which is where the defect would live:
 * multiplying the route's `maxSize` by five turns two of them red, and
 * disabling its type check turns four.
 *
 * WHY THE SERVER'S LIST IS NOT NARROWED TO MATCH. `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` is one
 * table read by three things — this route, the presigned Convex flow through
 * `validateMimeType`, and `/api/files`, whose servable set is DERIVED from it.
 * Dropping `image/svg+xml` from `products` would stop serving every product SVG
 * already in a client's bucket. So the server's bounds are recorded here as
 * what they are, including the one that surprises — an SVG IS accepted for a
 * dish, and sanitized on the way in — and the general rule below is what stops
 * the two halves drifting further apart.
