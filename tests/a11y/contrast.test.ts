/**
 * Every colour a diner or an owner is asked to read, measured.
 *
 * WHAT THIS HOLDS SHUT. #410, raised by the owner from real use — "parfois les
 * couleurs ne sont pas très visibles" — and then measured rather than argued
 * about. Measured at `e8a396e`: 794 foreground/background pairs below the WCAG
 * 2.1 AA floor across the storefront, the sign-in screens, the admin and the
 * two UI packages — 484 of them with a surface this sweep can resolve, and 226
 * of those in LIGHT mode, which is to say live for everyone with no dark phone
 * required. Some were not marginal:
 *
 *   1.07:1  the storefront footer's copyright, `text-accent-foreground/40` on
 *           `bg-primary-hover` — dark green on dark green
 *   1.10:1  every card on the storefront, in dark mode: `.storefront-theme`
 *           had no dark counterpart, so near-black storefront ink landed on
 *           the engine's near-black `--card`
 *   2.85:1  the engine's own `--primary`: a white label on `#f97015`, and any
 *           word written in `text-primary`
 *   4.42:1  `text-muted-foreground` on `bg-muted`, in 952 places
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SWEEP AND NOT A BROWSER. A browser measures the pages a test
 * mounts. This measures every page, including the ones no test mounts — which
 * is where the failures were. The arithmetic underneath is not trusted on its
 * own: it is checked against Chromium, with every colour read back off a canvas
 * so oklch, `color-mix` and alpha compositing are resolved by the engine rather
 * than re-implemented here. 194 of the first 199 pairs agreed to within 0.06;
 * re-run over the whole resolved set after the fixes, 389 of 398.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN THE APP AND THE ENGINE BOTH. The scanner and the WCAG maths
 * are in `@be-in-digital/ui` — the package that owns the colours, next to
 * `readableForeground` and the branding sweep that guards the DERIVED palette.
 * The regions are here because only the app knows which of its trees render
 * under which token scope, and because a client site cloned from this template
 * runs this same file over its own source.
 *
 * WHEN THIS GOES RED, the fix is a token, not a hex. A literal that fails is a
 * literal that escaped the design system: route it back through the token
 * layer and an establishment's own branding governs it, with
 * `readableForeground` guaranteeing the result. And never reach for `opacity`
 * or a `/60` modifier to soften text — it multiplies the ratio down silently,
 * which is how the footer got to 1.07:1.
