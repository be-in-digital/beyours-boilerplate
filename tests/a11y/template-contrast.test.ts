/**
 * Every palette a client is actually sold, measured.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `contrast.test.ts`. That sweep reads
 * `app/globals.css` and nothing else, so it measures the engine's default
 * palette — the one NO delivered site runs. `app/layout.tsx` imports
 * `./globals.css` and then `@/site/theme.css`, and `pnpm template:apply <slug>`
 * overwrites that second file from `templates/<slug>/theme.css`: 45 to 53 token
 * overrides, chosen at clone time, one of the 51 verticals under `templates/`.
 * Every one of those overrides is invisible to a sweep of `globals.css`.
 *
 * WHAT IT FOUND ON THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN. 50 of the 51 templates carried at
 * least one pair below the WCAG 2.1 AA floor. The dominant defect was one
 * mistake copied 50 times: every template set `--input` to the same value as
 * `--border`, which is exactly the defect `app/globals.css:126-135` had already
 * found and fixed for the engine, in a comment that says why — "the product
 * was, to a low-vision user, a rectangle that was not there". `--input` is the
 * boundary of every form field (`Input.tsx:12`), so every delivered site had
 * form fields whose edge was not there: 1.09:1 on `food-truck-tacoloco`,
 * 1.21:1 on `asiatique-bambou`, against the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a control.
 * Under it sat a quieter band of marginal misses — `--muted-foreground` at
 * 3.37:1 and a cluster of semantic inks at 4.32–4.49 — all of them on `--muted`.
 *
 * `templates/README.md` claimed "AA contrast verified: every palette passes
 * WCAG AA". Nothing measured it. This is what makes that sentence true, and it
 * is why the sentence now points here.
 *
 * WHAT IT DID NOT DO, AND NOW DOES. This file used to be the token matrix
 * ONLY, and said so: running `scanContrast` 51 times "would re-parse every
 * `.tsx` in the app once per template, which is minutes of CI", so the markup
 * was swept once under the default palette and "a pair that fails only for a
 * class combination unique to one template would fall between the two".
 *
 * That gap was the whole product. Measured with the argument wired through:
 * 49 of the 51 templates rendered at least one pair below AA, 272 pairs in
 * all, and the two guards were green for every one of them —
 * `pnpm template:apply asiatique-dragon` produced a site with 12 failing
 * pairs and a passing suite. The token matrix could not see them because a
 * failing pair is a COMBINATION (`text-primary` on `bg-muted`) that only the
 * markup names; the markup sweep could not see them because it read
 * `globals.css` and no template.
 *
 * The cost was also wrong. Measured: 28 seconds for all 51, not minutes — the
 * TypeScript parse dominates and it is the same parse each time.
 *
 * The two halves are still both here and both needed: the matrix catches a
 * token pair nothing happens to render TODAY, the sweep catches a combination
 * no matrix enumerates.
