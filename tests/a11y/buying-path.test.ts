/**
 * Every control a diner has to operate to place an order.
 *
 * WHAT THIS HOLDS SHUT — claims 4, 5 and 6 of #429, all measured on the bench
 * rather than argued about, and all still open when the audit re-ran them:
 *
 *   - `storefront-product-card.tsx` opened a dish from a `<div onClick>`.
 *     Measured live: `tabIndex: -1`, `role: null`. A keyboard user could not
 *     open a dish, and on this storefront that means they could not choose a
 *     REQUIRED option — so they could not order half the menu.
 *     `StoreSelectorContent.tsx` had the same shape on the screen where you
 *     pick a restaurant, which is the step before that.
 *   - 13 icon-only controls carried no accessible name, out of 162 examined:
 *     ten of them on a five-dish menu, two per dish. A fifty-dish carte is a
 *     hundred buttons that reach a screen reader as "button" and nothing else.
 *   - 17 of 35 `<Label>`s on the buying path had no `htmlFor`, and 20 of 38
 *     fields no `id` — including all five delivery-address fields at checkout.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SWEEP. The same reason `contrast.test.ts` gives: a browser
 * measures the pages a test mounts, and these failures were on the pages no
 * test mounts. It is a coarser instrument than an axe run — it cannot resolve a
 * name that comes from a rendered variable — so it is deliberately narrow about
 * what it calls a failure, and every rule below states what it does not catch.
