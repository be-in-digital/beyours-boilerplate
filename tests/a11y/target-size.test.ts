/**
 * No icon-only control is smaller than a finger.
 *
 * WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum), AA in WCAG 2.2: a pointer target is at
 * least 24 by 24 CSS pixels. A control labelled with a word is as large as the
 * word; a control labelled with a 16px icon is 16px unless something says
 * otherwise, and nothing did — the password reveal on the sign-in dialog was
 * 16 by 16, the smallest control in the product, and twenty more sat between
 * 12 and 22.
 *
 * WHY A SWEEP AND NOT A CHECKLIST. Every one of those twenty-one was written
 * by somebody who had no reason to think about it: `p-0.5` around an `h-3 w-3`
 * X on a filter chip is an ordinary line of markup. A list of known-bad
 * controls would have been out of date on the next chip. The instrument reads
 * the markup, so the next one is caught on the pull request that writes it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM. It measures size, not spacing — 2.5.8's exception for
 * a target with 24px of clearance around it is not evaluated, so a control this
 * suite passes at exactly 24 may still be uncomfortable next to another one.
 * And a size that arrives through a CSS file, an `asChild` slot or a runtime
 * class name is not resolved; those are skipped rather than guessed at. The
 * liveness test below is what stops that silence being mistaken for a pass.
