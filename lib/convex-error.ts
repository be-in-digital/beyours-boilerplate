/**
 * Reading the reason out of a `ConvexError`.
 *
 * Convex redacts the message of a plainly thrown `Error` in production — the
 * client receives "Server Error" — so every refusal the UI has to tell apart is
 * thrown as `ConvexError({ code, message })`, whose `data` survives. This is
 * the reader for the other end.
 *
 * It accepts `data` as an object OR as a JSON string. The browser client hands
 * back an object; `convex-test` hands back the serialized form. A screen that
 * silently degrades to a generic message under one of the two is a defect that
 * only shows up on the side nobody exercised.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `@be-in-digital/core` on purpose: the mirror
 * pins `beyours-boilerplate` to the last PUBLISHED core, so a client site would
 * fail to build on a core export that has not shipped yet.
