/**
 * The layout families a template picks from (#507).
 *
 * WHERE THIS COMES FROM. `demos/assets/site.css` declares the contract in its
 * own header, and `demos/assets/themes.js` assigns one value per family to each
 * of the fifty demo identities. Those identities are what
 * `scripts/gen-templates.mjs` already generates the catalogue from — it reads
 * `hero` and `menu` to write an English sentence into `template.json`'s
 * `description`, and throws the machine-readable value away. The other five
 * families it never reads at all.
 *
 * So a design sold "by restaurant type" arrived at a client as a palette, a
 * radius and a font pair, and the layout half of its identity stayed in the
 * sales demo. This table is the layout half, in a form the engine can act on.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTE OR COMPONENT VARIANT — THE ANSWER IS BOTH, AND THIS FILE USED TO
 * SAY OTHERWISE. It claimed that "every family there is pure CSS keyed on a
 * `data-*` attribute, over markup that does not change between variants". That
 * is true of `nav`, `btn`, `tex`, `foot` and `up`, and **false of `hero` and
 * `menu`** — the two that had not been implemented when it was written.
 *
 * `demos/assets/site.js` sets all seven attributes on `<html>` at `:121`, and
 * then decides those two by emitting different markup: `switch (T.hero)` at
 * `:323` returns a different `<section>` per value, and `renderMenu(dishes,
 * style, full)` at `:276` branches the same way. The CSS confirms it —
 * `.hero-editorial .stamp`, `.hero-poster .marq`, `.hero-magazine .rule` select
 * elements that exist in one variant only.
 *
 * That is why `HONOURED` below is per VALUE. Three of `hero`'s ten are
 * arrangements of what the engine's hero already holds, and those three are
 * ordinary CSS here; the other seven want a photograph, a second image, a
 * locations board, a marquee, or a rating stamp this product refuses to invent —
 * a different tree, not a different rule. A family is not atomic, and pretending
 * it was would have meant shipping none of the three or claiming all ten.
 *
 * WHERE THE ATTRIBUTE SITS, AND WHERE THE RULES MAY REACH. The attribute goes
 * on `<html>`, as it does in the demos. Every rule that reads it MUST be
 * confined to `.storefront-theme` — the shell's own div — because `<html>` is
 * the administration's ancestor too. That is the same lesson #410 and #41 cost:
 * name the element the storefront actually is, or you repaint the dashboard.
 * `app/globals.css` holds the rules, and a test refuses one that escapes.

 * `layout-families.test.ts` compares this against what exists, in both

/**
 * The `data-*` attributes for a layout, ready to spread onto `<html>`.
 *
 * TWO REASONS TO FALL BACK, AND THEY ARE THE SAME REASON (#529).
 *
 * A value outside its family falls back to the engine's rather than reaching
 * the DOM: an attribute no rule matches is invisible, and an invisible wrong
 * value is how a template silently renders as something else. The applier
 * refuses a template with no `layout.ts` at all, which is the loud half of the
 * same rule.
 *
 * A value INSIDE its family that nothing paints is the identical situation, and
 * the line used to be drawn at family membership instead. `hero: "poster"` is a
 * legal value with zero rules in `globals.css`, so the shop rendered `split`
 * while `<html>` said `poster`. Measured at `a92a0e51`: 31 of the 51 templates
 * named a hero the storefront does not paint, 26 a menu, and 51 a button style —
 * the whole `btn` family, since `HONOURED.btn` is empty.
 *
 * THE DECLARATION IS NOT LOST. It moves to `data-<family>-requested`, so the
 * markup says both what it renders and what the template asked for. Painting a
 * value is then one entry in `HONOURED` away from making the note disappear on
 * its own, and somebody asking "why is my poster hero not showing" finds the
 * answer in the DOM rather than in a stylesheet they have to search.
 *
 * `templates/README.md` carries the measured reason each value is unpainted —
 * `btn` waits on `--radius` reaching the shop at all, and the heroes and menus
 * want a photograph, a second image or a board the engine's components do not
 * carry.
