/**
 * Which Uber Direct quote an order should travel with.
 *
 * Pulled out of the checkout page because each branch decides what the customer
 * is charged, and a branch inside a submit handler is only reachable through a
 * browser. The page executes the decision; this file makes it.
 *
 * The server counterpart is `assertQuoteApplies` in the convex-functions
 * package: it re-checks existence, tenant, expiry, single use and the bond to
 * the address the quote priced. Nothing here is a security boundary — a browser
 * can send any id it likes. This decides which id an honest browser sends, and
 * therefore whether the fee charged is the fee displayed.
