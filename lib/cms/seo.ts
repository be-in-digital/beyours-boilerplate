/**
 * Generate Metadata from CMS seo block.

 * Two faults used to stop this reaching the `<head>` at all, and both are
 * fixed — verified by execution, not by reading this paragraph. It required a
 * `storeSlug` cookie that nothing writes, a leftover of the removed
 * `/s/[storeSlug]` routing, so every page fell through to its hard-coded
 * fallback title; it now resolves the establishment itself. And it read the
 * locale from a cookie named `locale` while the app writes `beid_locale`, so
 * the metadata came back in the source language whatever the visitor had
 * picked. `tests/ssr/locale-cookie.test.ts` holds both.
 *
 * A third fault outlived that comment: the robots directive was read with
 * `robots.includes("index")`, and `"noindex"` contains `"index"`. Every page an
 * owner had marked "do not index" was published to Google with
 * `{ index: true, follow: true }`. The parse now lives in `parseRobotsDirective`
 * and is by token; `tests/ssr/seo-metadata.test.ts` holds it.
