 * There was none. The header block next to it set five other security headers,
 * so the omission read like a decision rather than a gap.
 *
 * What this policy is, and is not
 * -------------------------------
 * `script-src` still carries `'unsafe-inline'`. Next.js bootstraps hydration
 * from inline `<script>` tags, and the alternative — a per-request nonce — has
 * to be minted in middleware, which opts every page out of static rendering.
 * That is a rendering-architecture decision, not a security fix, and it is not
 * made here.
 *
 * So this policy does not stop injected inline script. What it does stop is
 * cheap and worth having: `<base>` hijacking, plugin and object embedding,
 * framing by another site, and forms that post somewhere else.
 *
 * It is deliberately not the control that closes the stored-XSS report. That
 * one is `buildFileResponseHeaders` in `lib/services/file-serving.ts`, which
 * puts `default-src 'none'; sandbox` on every proxied upload — a strict policy,
 * on the only responses whose bodies a user supplied, needing no nonce.
