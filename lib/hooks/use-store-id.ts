 * Hook: useStoreId
 *
 * Resolves the store the visitor is browsing:
 *   persisted selection > nearest store (geolocation) > first store
 *
 * The selection is an id, and the document comes back from Convex, so a
 * renamed store or a change of opening hours reaches the visitor on the next
 * render. Storing the whole document meant it stayed frozen in localStorage.
 *
 * The visitor is never asked for their position here. If they granted it
 * earlier the nearest store wins; otherwise the first one does. Asking on
 * arrival - which is what this used to do on every storefront page - puts a
 * permission prompt in front of someone who came to read a menu.
 *
 * Every candidate here comes from `stores.list`, which returns only published
 * establishments. That is what keeps the automatic selection off a draft: this
 * hook picks blind, so a draft in the list would be picked like any other, and
 * the visitor would land on a restaurant nobody has opened yet.

   * that as "this visitor has no restaurant": a cold arrival at /checkout with
   * a full basket was sent to /store-selector, every time. Reporting the render
   * as loading says what is true of it - nothing is resolved, and something
   * will be.
   *
   * An empty list is not that: there is nothing to pick, and `null` is the
   * final answer rather than a pending one.
