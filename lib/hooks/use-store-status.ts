/**
 * Hook: useStoreStatus
 *
 * Queries a store by ID and returns its real-time status:
 * - open/closed based on hours
 * - store status field (draft/open/closed/temporarily_unavailable)
 * - current day hours
 * - available services
 *
 * Two things it used to get wrong, both of them settings the dashboard writes
 * and this hook did not read (#169):
 *
 * - It took `store.hours` unconditionally, so `useGlobalHours` decided nothing.
 *   An owner who edited the global week and left every location on "horaires
 *   globaux" changed nothing a visitor could see — the storefront kept showing
 *   the hard-coded 09:00–22:00 that `stores.create` seeds.
 * - It compared against the visitor's own clock. `globalSettings.timezone` was
 *   written and never read, so a customer abroad got the wrong answer and
 *   anyone could change it by changing their system clock.
 * - It returned `store.overrides.services` raw, and that override is
 *   `undefined` on every establishment that has not customised it. The
 *   order-type selector read `undefined` as "offer everything", so a restaurant
 *   that does not deliver still showed Livraison.
