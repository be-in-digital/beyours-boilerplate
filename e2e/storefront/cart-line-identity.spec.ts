/**
 * Two configurations of one dish are two lines.
 *
 * The cart keyed every action on `productId`. One pizza with extra cheese and
 * one plain looked like two lines and behaved like one: "+" on either raised
 * both and doubled the total before checkout, and the bin on either emptied
 * both. The unit tests hold the rule; this holds what the customer's thumb
 * actually does to it, at the width most of them order from.
 *
 * The cart is seeded through localStorage rather than by walking the menu:
 * this deployment may serve no catalogue at all, and the bug lives in the cart,
 * not in the path to it.
