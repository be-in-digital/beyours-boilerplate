/**
 * The player route renders the real flow, in both apps.
 *
 * This is the regression guard for #159. `apps/themes` shipped a placeholder
 * here for months — a purple card reading "Gamification flow will be
 * implemented here" — while the bench ran the whole wheel/scratch flow, and the
 * gap was recorded as deliberate instead of closed. The backend was live on
 * every client deployment the entire time.
 *
 * The assertions deliberately do not need seeded game data. Whatever the code
 * resolves to, the real flow answers with one of its own screens — the arena
 * shell while `getSession` is in flight, or "le jeu fait une pause" once it
 * comes back empty. The placeholder answers with neither. That is the whole
 * difference this spec exists to hold, and it holds with or without a backend.
