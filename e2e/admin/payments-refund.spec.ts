/**
 * The payments screen, and the refund that starts on it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `/dashboard/payments` had no end-to-end coverage at
 * all: the only proof that a refund was reachable was a unit test grepping the
 * route file for the string "PaymentsPage". `PaymentsPage` could have thrown on
 * its first render and every unit test would still have been green. The refund
 * button had already been dead once — wired to a Convex mutation that no longer
 * existed — and source-level greps are exactly what let that ship.
 *
 * WHY IT SEEDS ITS OWN DATA. `seedFixture` creates a restaurant, a catalogue
 * and a team, and no orders and no payments. A spec that walked the table it
 * found would find nothing and pass, which is the failure mode this file exists
 * to avoid: `order-detail.spec.ts` wraps every assertion in `if (hasOrder)` and
 * reports success against an empty database. The fixture below is created
 * through the app's own Convex functions before anything is asserted, and a
 * seed that fails FAILS the test rather than skipping it.
 *
 * WHERE THE PROOF STOPS. There are no payment-provider credentials in CI, and
 * a fake Stripe answer would only test the fake. The seeded payment carries no
 * `externalId`, so `routeRefund()` classes it "unsupported" and the action
 * refuses BEFORE it would call a provider. What is proved is the whole chain up
 * to that point — button, dialog, amounts, submit, server action, answer — and
 * that the ledger is left untouched when the provider step cannot run. Money
 * actually moving is not testable here, and nothing below pretends it is.
