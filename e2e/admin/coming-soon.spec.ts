  // `Game{Catalog,QrCodes,Actions,Winners}Page`, and `games.spec.ts` asserts
  // them. `/dashboard/games/settings` is absent for a different reason — the
  // route has no page in either app. It was declared in `adminRoutes` and
  // linked from nowhere, so the constant went rather than the 404 being
  // tolerated here.
  // The list was named for a fact that had stopped being true, and then the
  // correction went stale in turn: `/dashboard/content/components` is now the
  // ONLY route here that renders `<ComingSoon/>`. Email, CMS pages and blog
  // became real screens, and `/dashboard/customers` did too — it renders
  // `CustomersPage`, the customer book #364 built, since #481. They stay in the
  // list — a smoke test over the routes an owner opens first is worth keeping —
  // but neither the name nor the describe claims otherwise any more.
