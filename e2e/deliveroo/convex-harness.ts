/**
 * The Convex harness the Deliveroo scenario suites run against.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * Every suite in this directory used to build a fixture with the helpers in
 * `test-config.ts` and then assert on that same fixture:
 *
 *     const webhook = createNewOrderWebhook({ fulfillment_type: "restaurant" })
 *     expect(webhook.body.order.fulfillment_type).toBe("restaurant")
 *
 * That reads `createNewOrderWebhook` back to itself. It cannot fail, it touches
 * no product code, and 188 blocks across the two apps were shaped exactly like
 * it — which is how eleven Deliveroo defects survived five green CI runs.
 *
 * The fixtures were never the problem: they encode real payload shapes from
 * Deliveroo's API docs — meal cards, offer discounts, scheduled orders,
 * remakes, missing PLUs. What was missing was a receiver. This file is that
 * receiver: `convex-test` mounts the app's real Convex backend, and
 * `postSigned()` sends a fixture at the real HTTP route with a real Deliveroo
 * HMAC, so a suite can assert on what the handler WROTE rather than on what
 * the test itself passed in.
 *
 * The live `it.runIf(hasWebhookTarget)` blocks in scenarios 2 and 8 are
 * untouched by any of this. They post at a deployed backend, they skip loudly
 * when one is not configured (`announceSkippedLiveRun`), and they were always
 * honest about it.
