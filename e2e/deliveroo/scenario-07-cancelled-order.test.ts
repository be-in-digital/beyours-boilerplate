 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * @description
 * Deliveroo's certification scenario 7: an order cancelled by the customer or
 * by the platform. A cancellation from a platform is a FACT, not a request —
 * the food is off whatever our own status machine would have allowed — and
 * the interesting cases are the edges: the retry that changes nothing, the
 * cancellation that arrives after the food was handed over, and the spelling.
 *
 * The straight case (a cancellation stops the kitchen, including one for an
 * order already being prepared) is covered in
 * `tests/convex/deliveroo-webhook.test.ts`; this file deliberately owns what
 * that one does not, so neither is padding for the other.
 *
 * Of the eleven blocks this file used to hold, exactly one touched product
 * code — the transition-table check below, kept as it was. The other ten
 * asserted that `createStatusUpdateWebhook(id, "cancelled")` had produced the
 * status "cancelled".
