/**
 * The Deliveroo webhook signature these suites produce — pinned, and proved
 * against the code that actually verifies it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * `createSignature()` used to sign the request body alone. The verifier signs
 * `sequence_guid + " " + raw body`, so every webhook these suites ever sent
 * would have come back 401. Nobody found out, because the suites that send
 * webhooks skip whenever `CONVEX_SITE_URL` and a Deliveroo secret are unset —
 * so a signature that could never be accepted looked exactly like a green run,
 * for eleven suites, indefinitely.
 *
 * Two independent anchors, because one of them alone can be wrong quietly:
 *
 *  1. Expected digests computed OUTSIDE this codebase with LibreSSL, so a
 *     mistake in `createSignature()` cannot also produce its own expectation:
 *
 *         printf '%s %s' "$GUID" "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$SECRET"
 *
 *  2. The real verifier and the real route. `verifyWebhookSignature` is
 *     exported from `@be-in-digital/integrations` and the Convex HTTP action
 *     is mounted here with `convex-test`, so a signature this directory
 *     produces is put in front of the code that will judge it in production.
 *
 * That second anchor is new. This file used to say the verifier "is
 * module-private and cannot be imported" and restate the algorithm by hand —
 * then assert that restatement against `createSignature`. Two copies of the
 * same idea agreeing with each other proves nothing about the third copy that
 * runs in production; the claim was also simply false, and the restatement is
 * gone.
 *
 * It still needs no network, no deployment, no secrets and no Convex
 * credentials, so it runs in ordinary CI on every push. That is the point: the
 * live suites cannot be relied on to notice.
