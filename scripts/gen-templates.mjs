 * - theme.css: light/dark tokens + sidebar + radius, derived exactly the way

 *
 * Language note: everything the generator emits — theme.css and fonts.ts

   * badge label asks — and `template-contrast.test.ts` then reported 490 failures
   * across the catalogue, because the token is also written as INK (4.5:1 against
   * `--background`, `--card` and `--muted`) and a colour chosen only to carry
   * white does not clear a light page. `globals.css` says the same thing about
   * its own value in a comment: "34% clears at 4.511".
   *
   * So it is walked against the surfaces, away from the page in whichever mode
   * this is — light in dark mode, dark in light mode — and the LABEL is then
   * chosen to suit whatever that produced, rather than assumed to be white. That
   * is what `buildBrandingCss` does for the per-store path, and the two now agree.

   * The badge has to satisfy TWO measurements at once, so both are walked here.

   * "34% clears at 4.511") AND it is a FILL that must carry a LABEL. One colour,
   * two floors, and the two pull in opposite directions in dark mode: walking it
   * lighter to clear a dark page makes white on it worse.
   *
   * Two earlier attempts are worth recording, because each was refuted by

   * produced 490 failures across the catalogue — the ink half was unmet. Walking

   * foreground produced 100 — in dark mode both candidate labels are light, and a
   * light label on a light badge is the 2.78:1 the engine's comment already warns
   * about.

/* Two wording warts this generator used to emit, keep them fixed:

 *   a stutter ("carte carte typographiée"). */
/*
 * The layout half of an identity (#507).
 *
 * `demos/assets/themes.js` has carried all seven families since the demos were
 * written, and this generator read exactly two of them — `hero` and `menu` —
 * to compose an English sentence for `template.json`'s `description`, throwing
 * the machine-readable value away. So the catalogue shipped the palette and the
 * fonts and left the layout in the sales demo, which is what #507 is about.
 *
 * `up` is a NUMBER in the source (0 / 1) and a string on the DOM, because it
 * becomes `data-up`. Stringified here, at the one place that knows both sides,
 * rather than in the template where fifty copies could disagree.
 *
 * The allowed values live in `lib/layout-families.ts`; `layout-families.test.ts`
 * holds this generator's output against them, so a family renamed in the demos
 * fails here rather than at a client.

## Adapting to the client
1. \`--primary\` + \`--ring\` + \`--sidebar-primary\`: the client's signature
   color (keep AA contrast against \`--primary-foreground\`).
2. \`--accent\` / \`--accent-foreground\`: same hue, diluted for backgrounds,
   darkened for text.
3. Semantic tokens (\`--success\`, \`--warning\`, \`--destructive\`,
   \`--status-*\`): left to the engine, do not redefine them.
