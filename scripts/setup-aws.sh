# BeYours Engine - AWS S3 & SES Setup Script
#
# Configures:
#   1. A PRIVATE S3 bucket, with PUT-only CORS, version-expiring lifecycle rules
#      and folders
#   2. SES domain identity with DKIM verification
#   3. SES email sending configuration
#   4. SES bounce and complaint feedback: an SNS topic, the identity
#      notifications that publish to it WITH the original headers, and a
#      subscription pointing at the deployment's /webhooks/ses
#   5. IAM user with minimal permissions for the app
#
# The bucket is private and nothing here makes it public. Media reaches the
# browser through the app's /api/files proxy, or through a CDN with an origin
# access control - see apps/docs/deployment/s3-bucket-policy.md. An earlier
# version of this script relaxed the public access block and attached a
# public-read policy; it now removes such a policy if it finds one (issue #198).
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x scripts/setup-aws.sh
#   ./scripts/setup-aws.sh
#   SITE_ORIGIN=https://restaurant.example ./scripts/setup-aws.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - AWS CLI configured (aws configure)
#   - Sufficient IAM permissions (S3, SES, IAM, Route53 optional)
#   - node on PATH, to classify an existing bucket policy. Without it the
#     script still blocks all public access; it just leaves any existing
#     policy in place and tells you to check it.
# ============================================================================

# ── Configuration ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ⚠️ THE `beindigital-*` NAMES BELOW ARE AWS RESOURCES, NOT BRANDING.
#
# They designate infrastructure that already exists in the account: an S3
# bucket (globally unique name), an IAM user, an IAM policy and an SES
# configuration set. Renaming them here does not rename anything in AWS — it
# makes the script provision a second, parallel, empty set, and points new
# clients at a bucket that holds none of the existing media. Sending mail with
# a configuration set that does not exist fails outright.
#
# This happened on 2026-08-16: the BeYours rename swept `beindigital-engine`
# into `beyours-engine` across the repository and caught these five along the
# way. Renaming them requires renaming the AWS resources first — which, for an
# S3 bucket, means creating a new one and copying the objects over.

# ── Per-client mode ──
# One AWS account per client (apps/docs/deployment/aws-ownership.md). Give a
# site slug and the client's sending domain, and every resource is named for
# that client inside whatever account the AWS CLI is pointed at:
#
#   SITE_SLUG=chez-mario DOMAIN=chez-mario.fr ./scripts/setup-aws.sh
#
# With no SITE_SLUG the script keeps the fleet-wide names above, unchanged,
# because they designate resources that already exist in the shared account.
# That is the legacy model; new clients should not be provisioned into it.

# No bucket policy is attached, deliberately. The IAM user created in step 4
# carries s3:GetObject / s3:PutObject / s3:DeleteObject on this bucket, plus the
# three VERSION permissions the bucket's versioning makes necessary
# (s3:ListBucketVersions, s3:GetObjectVersion, s3:DeleteObjectVersion) — without
# them the app can only write delete markers, which delete nothing. That is all
# the app needs. Adding a policy that grants s3:GetObject to "*" would make
# every uploaded file world-readable and permanently un-revocable - including a
# file uploaded by a hostile account. That is what #185/#187 closed.
#
# A CDN is the supported way to serve media without the proxy: give CloudFront
# an origin access control and let it write its own bucket policy, then set
# AWS_S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL. The bucket stays closed to the public internet.

# ── Lifecycle rules ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The only rule here used to be CleanupIncompleteUploads, and that made the
# versioning enabled above a one-way ratchet: nothing ever left the bucket.
#
# On a VERSIONED bucket a DeleteObject without a VersionId deletes nothing. It
# writes a *delete marker* over the key and retains every prior version — still
# billed, still readable by anyone who can name a version id. So « definitivement
# supprime » in the media library kept every byte, the offboarding runbook ticked
# an erasure box the infrastructure could not honour, and storage grew without
# ceiling. Issue #331.
#
# The app now purges versions itself: convex/cmsMediaDelete.ts, which is the
# only media-deletion path the delivered app runs. (packages/core's
# S3Service.delete does the same for a consumer of that package, and only when
# the injected S3Operations adapter implements listObjectVersions and
# deleteObjectVersion — they are optional on the interface. Nothing in apps/*
# calls it.) These two rules are the floor under all of that: they collect what
# a purge could not reach — objects deleted before the purge existed,
# deployments whose IAM policy predates s3:DeleteObjectVersion, adapters without
# the version methods, and the noncurrent versions of a file that was merely
# overwritten rather than deleted.
#
# NoncurrentVersionExpiration is 30 days rather than 1. Versioning is also an
# accident-recovery control: a client who overwrites the wrong photograph has a
# month to say so. An erasure REQUEST is not served by waiting — the app purges
# by version id for that, and NewerNoncurrentVersions keeps the window from
# meaning "keep 400 revisions of a logo for a month".
#
# Both rules are needed and neither substitutes for the other:
#   - expiring the versions leaves the delete marker, which keeps the key
#     listed as deleted and still costs a request to enumerate;
#   - expiring the marker alone UN-DELETES the file, because the newest
#     remaining version becomes current again.
#
# The fourth rule is the retention of the NIGHTLY BACKUP that convex/crons.ts
# now writes under backups/ (issue #366). Thirty daily copies, expired by the
# bucket rather than by a cron: a lifecycle rule keeps working while the
# deployment is down, which is the circumstance a backup exists for. Its
# noncurrent window is 1 day rather than 30 - each night writes a NEW key, so a
# noncurrent version of a backup only exists if one was overwritten, and keeping
# those for a month would silently triple what the retention says.
#
# `backups/` is deliberately NOT one of the eleven S3_FOLDERS. That constant
# drives the /api/files proxy's allow-list, and a backup reachable over HTTP is
# the whole database served to whoever guesses a key.

#
# WHAT WAS MISSING. The configuration set above was created with no destination
# of any kind, and no SNS topic existed anywhere in this script. `POST
# /webhooks/ses` is routed in `convex/http.ts` and nothing ever caused AWS to
# call it, so `emailSubscribers.markBounced` and `markComplained` had no way to
# fire. A dead mailbox therefore stayed `active` and was re-mailed on every
# campaign, and AWS suspends a sending account at a 5 % complaint rate — with
# nothing in the product able to explain why the mail stopped.
#
# WHY IDENTITY NOTIFICATION TOPICS AND NOT AN EVENT DESTINATION. The two
# publish DIFFERENT JSON. A configuration set event destination sends the
# event-publishing envelope, keyed `eventType`; an identity notification topic
# sends the classic notification envelope, keyed `notificationType`, with
# `bounce.bounceType` and `mail.destination` beside it. `handleSesWebhook`
# switches on `notificationType` (`convex/emailHttpHandlers.ts`), so an event
# destination would deliver a body that parses, matches no case, and is dropped
# — which looks exactly like the silence it was meant to end.
#
# WHY THE HEADERS FLAG IS NOT OPTIONAL. The handler correlates a bounce to a
# subscriber through `X-Store-Id` / `X-Subscriber-Id` / `X-Campaign-Id`,
# injected at send time and readable only from `mail.headers` — and SES OMITS
# `mail.headers` from a notification unless the identity is told to include the
# original headers. Without the two commands below the endpoint receives every
# bounce and can act on none of them.
#
# Feedback forwarding is deliberately left alone: setting a topic does not turn
# the operator's own bounce emails off, and having both while a client is new is
# worth more than a tidy inbox.
