/**
 * What the cart just did, said out loud.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, at `b9e20ea`. Adding a dish reached a screen reader —
 * `sonner` renders its toasts into a live region and the product card raises
 * one. Every mutation after that was silent: the quantity buttons, removing a
 * line, emptying the Box, the count on the header badge, the subtotal and the
 * total are all bare `<span>`s, and a `<span>` whose text changes announces
 * nothing at all. Across the 36 files on the buying path there were four
 * `aria-live`/`role="status"` attributes and none of them was in a cart. So a
 * blind diner could press « Augmenter la quantité » four times and be told
 * nothing four times, with no way to know what they were about to pay.
 *
 * WHY ONE REGION, IN THE SHELL, AND NOT ONE PER CONTROL. A live region has to
 * be in the document BEFORE its contents change — a region that is inserted
 * already holding text is not reliably announced. The cart sheet is a dialog
 * that unmounts when closed, so a region inside it would miss every mutation
 * made from a product card, which is most of them. `StorefrontShell` is
 * mounted for the whole storefront, which makes this the one place that hears
 * all of them.
 *
 * WHAT IT SAYS is the state, not the verb: "Box : 3 articles, 24,50 €". The
 * toast already names the action for an addition, and repeating it here would
 * queue two announcements for one event. The state is also the thing the other
 * mutations have no way of saying — the diner who pressed « - » wants the new
 * count and the new total, and both of them are the numbers on the screen they
 * cannot see.
 *
 * NOT ON MOUNT. Rehydrating a persisted cart is not an event the diner caused,
 * and announcing it would talk over the page they just opened.

    Adjusted DURING render, not in an effect — React's own pattern for state
    derived from something that changed, and the reason is not style. An effect
    that calls `setState` runs after the browser has painted, so the region
    would be filled a frame late and, more to the point, `react-hooks` refuses
    it: a synchronous `setState` in an effect body cascades renders. Here React
    re-renders immediately, before committing anything, and the region goes from
    empty to holding the sentence — which is the transition a live region
    announces.

    The first render initialises `seen` to whatever the cart already holds, so a
    cart rehydrated from `localStorage` is silent: that is not something the
