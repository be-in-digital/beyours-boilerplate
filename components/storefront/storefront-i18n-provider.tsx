/**
 * Storefront i18n initialiser.
 *
 * Everything the language store needs was already written; nothing filled it.
 * `initialize` had one call site, in a component that was never mounted;
 * `setOverrides` and `setStaticStrings` had none at all. So `isReady` stayed
 * false, `availableLanguages` stayed empty, `locale` stayed at its literal
 * `'fr'`, and switching language changed `<html lang>` and not one word a
 * customer could read.
 *
 * This mounts once, inside the storefront shell, and fills all three:
 *   1. the establishment's active languages → `initialize`
 *   2. the restaurateur's manual UI overrides → `setOverrides`
 *   3. the static JSON catalogues for those languages → `setStaticStrings`
 *
 * It renders nothing. Components read the result through `useTranslation()`.
